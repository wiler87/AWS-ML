    "### Data processing with a pipeline and ColumnTransformer\n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical ML workflow, you need to apply data transformations, such as imputation and scaling, at least twice: first on the training dataset by using `.fit()` and `.transform()` when preparing the data to train the model, and then by using `.transform()` on any new data that you want to predict on (validation or test). Sklearn's [Pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html) is a tool that simplifies this process by enforcing the implementation and order of data processing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will build separate pipelines to handle the numerical, categorical, and text features. Then, you will combine them into a composite pipeline along with an estimator. To do this, you will use a [LogisticRegression classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need multiple pipelines to ensure that all the data is handled correctly:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * __Numerical features pipeline:__  Impute missing values with the mean by using sklearn's `SimpleImputer`, followed by `MinMaxScaler`. If different processing is desired for different numerical features, different pipelines should be built as described for the text features pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * __Categoricals pipeline:__ Impute with a placeholder value (this won't have an effect because you already encoded the `nan` values), and encode with sklearn's `OneHotEncoder`. If computing memory is an issue, it is a good idea to check the number of unique values for the categoricals to get an estimate of how many dummy features one-hot encoding will create. Note the `handle_unknown` parameter, which tells the encoder to ignore (rather than throw an error for) any unique value that might show in the validation or test set that was not present in the initial training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * __Text features pipeline:__ With memory usage in mind, build three more pipelines, one for each of the text features. The current sklearn implementation requires a separate transformer for each text feature (unlike the numericals and categoricals).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the selective preparations of the dataset features are then put together into a collective ColumnTransformer, which is used in a pipeline along with an estimator. This ensures that the transforms are performed automatically in all situations. This includes on the raw data when fitting the model, when making predictions, when evaluating the model on a validation dataset through cross-validation, or when making predictions on a test dataset in the future."

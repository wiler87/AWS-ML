[],Fly Fishing for Trout (Lefty's Little Library of Fly Fishing) (5 Volume Set),[],,"6,457,880 in Books (",[],Books,98.95,B0014HDAHI,"{'Publisher:': 'Odysseus', 'ASIN:': 'B0014HDAHI', '\n    Package Dimensions: \n    ': '9 x 6 x 1 inches', 'Shipping Weight:': '1.4 pounds'}","Lefty began fly-fishing in 1947 while serving as a guide for the famous fly fisherman Joe Brooks. In 1964 he moved to Miami, Florida and began to fish for salt water species in the Florida Keys. It was during this time that Lefty Kreh, Joe Brooks, Al Pflueger, Tom McNally, George Hommel, Stu Apte and others pioneered the techniques, deviating from the classic ""Ten to Two"" casting technique, that modern salt water anglers use to pursue fish with fly fishing gear. The Lefty's Deceiver is an artificial fly commonly categorized as a streamer fly which is fished under the water surface. It is a popular and widely used pattern for both predacious freshwater and saltwater game fish. It is generally considered one of the top patterns to have in any fly box. Lefty Kreh invented the Deceiver fly in the late 1950s as a streamer that would be easy to cast in wind and would not ""foul"" (or wrap around the bend of the hook) a common problem for older streamer patterns. The original Lefty's Deceiver was tied in an all white pattern, but fly tiers have recreated the pattern in a variety of colors. A darker colored top with a lighter bottom (mimicking the various forage fishes that larger fishes feed upon) is the most popular design. The Deceiver is arguably the best known saltwater fly pattern in the world. In 2010, the first Lefty Kreh Flyfishing Challenge Course was created as the centerpiece of instruction at HomeWaters University, which is located in Spruce Creek, Pennsylvania. Lefty designed the course himself, incorporating dry land, still water and moving water into various casting stations. Lefty calls it a challenge course, as opposed to a casting course, because he included real-world fly-fishing conditions. Scenarios include the need for long casts, short and precise presentations, casting into the wind, casting with no room for a back cast, and dealing with boulders, rapidly moving water, logs and other floating debris."

The articulateness and intimacy of her recounting the years both before meeting Michael Manley and afterward, of their life together as leading figures in the Peoples National Party, are a compelling contribution to literature as well as government studies. Beverley Manley reports with the aplomb of a seasoned interviewer on television and radio. She speaks with an authoritative yet friendly voice and records the political and the personal as one who is committed to feminist issues. Manley tells of her struggle to escape the confinement of her relationship with an argumentative and domineering mother and of her success both before and after marriage with working in the media. She is a fine scholar and architect of womens rights in Jamaica, and she holds nothing back in touching on all the issues that were of such consequence in the era of cataclysmic change in Jamaican society under her husbands leadership. Beverley Manley speaks with a gentle and winning voice from her own commitment to a leftist positioning in politics. She need make no apology for this for it is after all her own memoirs that she is articulating with such clarity and force. Her accounting of her growing up as the stationmasters daughter is an interesting record of a time when girls still had to wear the Oblood cloth. She recounts the caring for (washing) and difficulty of this awkward garment and this candour previews the openness with which she will discuss her marriage in later chapters. Manley has a zest for life and a love of femininity that pervades the otherwise serious text of the rise of the PNP and its ultimate fall with the elections of 1980. In between those years is the story of the growth of a dream for a more equitable Jamaica than the one that existed at that time. Beverley Manley is able to articulate the growth of the structures of government with clarity and vision. She was after all a young black woman who was coming into her own as a scholar and First Lady. Her ability to recall and recount these turbulent years with vivid aplomb is a boon for the reader who is interested in reliving them  revisiting them through her point of view. Her early days as First Lady are summarised in the following statement: There was no doubt some in the party regarded me with a certain amount of suspicion. I collaborated with many members of parliament in their constituencies  and not only at election time. I was a hard and committed worker who was never interested in representative politics. People did not understand this. Manley worked as hard to establish herself within the family. She became a wife that was on good terms with Mardi and Pardi (Edna and Norman W Manley) as well as with Michaels children by his former marriages. She recalls that she showed her manuscript to Rachel at a difficult time in the writing and it was Rachels encouragement that helped her move through to completion. It would have been a great loss to social history and to feminist studies otherwise. Manleys memoirs are replete with information that encourages all women, especially in the island where machismo is still so dominant. Manley says: During another conversation with Fidel, as we talked about the workers struggle, he told me that, as difficult as it was, it would triumph long before the struggle for womens rights. I was upset at the time by his words, but have since come to understand how correct he was about the intransigence of the movement for equality between women and men. Throughout this fine text are such thoughts and asides that help to centre the narrative in wo --The Jamaica Observer,Beverly Manley is former Jamaican model, and popular media personality in Jamaica, hosting highly respected talk shows discussing issues of national, regional and international importance.,,"

The world was desperate for change. In order to turn things around spiritually, fiscally and morally, one thing was needed. It was time for a revival; a revival that would need to take place nationally, internationally and personally. When our Family Leader team met after the summit to focus on prayer and contemplation, the vision became even more clear. We opened the Bible and the word if was right in front of our eyes. We knew right then that we had found our starting point. Born from this revelation and based around our strong belief that the power of prayer is key for revival, If 7:14 is a call to action for the entire world to pray twice a day  once at 7:14am and once again at 7:14pm. Imagine if we could better our personal lives and our marriages. Just think if we could change, not only at home, but, at work, in our communities and our churches in our countries and our world. The time for revival is here. If 7:14 is a response to that need for revival."

The CIA has detected and intercepted two terrorist cells, but a third is feared to be on the loose. Led by a dangerous mastermind obsessed with becoming the leader of al-Qaeda, this determined and terrifying group is about to descend on America.

Rapp needs the best on this assignment, and Nash, who has served his government honorably for sixteen years, is his choice. Together, they have never wavered in the fight against the jihadists and their culture of death. Both have fought the war on terrorism in secret without accolades or acknowledgment of their personal sacrifices. Both have been forced to lie to virtually every single person they care about, and both have soldiered on with the knowledge that their hard work and lethal tactics have saved thousands of lives. But the political winds have changed in America, and certain leaders on Capitol Hill are pushing to have men like Rapp and Nash put back on a short leash. And then one spring afternoon in Washington, DC, everything changes.

Using his insider knowledge of intelligence agencies and the military, Flynn once again delivers an all-too-real portrayal of a war that is waged every day by a handful of brave, devoted souls. Smart, fast-paced, and jaw-droppingly realistic, Extreme Measures is the political thriller of our time."

And yet, even with all our low-fat products, we're fatter and sicker than ever before. What's going on? Could it be that the most feared food group is actually...the most helpful? As 'Pegan Plan' creator and author Dr Mark Hyman explains in Eat Fat Get Thin, a growing body of research is revealing the immense health and weight-loss benefits of a high-fat diet rich in eggs, nuts, oils, avocados, coconut oil, and other delicious superfoods. That's right - as it turns out, the key to losing weight, increasing overall energy, and achieving optimum wellness is eating more fat, not less. Dr Hyman debunks some of our most persistent fat-phobic myths and clearly explains the science behind fat's health benefits."

by Jim Wilcox with a foreword by B Byron Price and an introduction by Mark Wilcox (Hard Cover, 192 pgs.)

The West is best known for its beauty, mountains, and wide open places.

Jim Wilcox is best known for capturing the West on canvas.

As a full-time artist since 1969, Wilcox has been Canvassing the West with his vivid impressionistic landscapes. Through his travels and local outings, he has created thousands of paintings that narrow down and embody the Spirit of the West while still conveying its grandeur. His fine artistic style and compositional good sense have helped to make him one of the most recognized artists in Western art. He has received many major awards, including the Prix de West Award in 1987 and the Frederic Remington Award in both 2002 and 2007 from the prestigious Prix de West Show.

As a resident of Jackson Hole, WY Wilcox is perhaps best known for portraying his beloved Teton Range. But his talent extends far beyond the valley he lives in. He has traveled extensively and painted many places throughout the world.

With nearly 200 color reproductions of Wilcoxs work, Canvassing the West exhibits his variety in subject matter, from sweeping vistas to intimate shorelines, along with plenty of his favorite Teton scenes.

This long-overdue compilation of Wilcoxs work is a needed tribute to the career of one of the Wests most inspired and inspiring landscape artists."

Next winter miners sported skis, then known as Norwegian ""snow-shoes."" Soon the region swarmed with men, women & children sliding about on snow-shoes. Doctors, Expressmen, mailmen, including famed Snow-Shoe Thompson, tracked the region on skis. La Porte, first gold site, welcomed winter sports. In 1868 La Porte's Alturas Snow-shoe Club staged the world's first organized downhill ski races. Miners hit up to 80 mph, racing for rich gold purses on skis 12 feet long!

Rugged terrain cut the Lost Sierra from the rest of the world. Three forks of the mighty Feather River lace its forests with deep canyons. Rivers left towering peaks & sharp ridges. Quincy, Plumas County seat, stands at the northern gateway; Marysville guards the West; Downieville borders the south, Johnsville, headquarters of today's Plumas Eureka State Park, faces east. The Lost Sierra became deserted as mining towns, except La Porte, died."

The authors deftly tell the stories of both Henry Ford and the FoMoCo enterprise against a background of the times which createde their success. Here we see the early Henry Ford (this volume ends whin Ford was 52 years old), grasping for a way to make money out of this infant technology. We also see the chaotic state of an industry which had great potential, but which had not as yet determined what the nature of its product would be (gas, electric, steam, tool for the masses, plaything for the rich). The treatment of Ford's fight against the Seldon patent is especially well told.

Fox ( Possum Magic ; Guess What? ) offers sweet but slim verse that bids good night to a selection of animals being cuddled and coddled by their mothers, all endearingly rendered at eye-level. The rhymed couplets have a pleasantly lilting rhythm, if an occasionally trite rhyme scheme: ""It's time for bed, little sheep, little sheep, / The whole wide world is going to sleep."" After viewing the various animals nodding off, youngsters will take their bedtime cue from a cherubic toddler, whose blond head falls into a pillow covered with golden stars as mother offers a hug and the text concludes: ""The stars on high are shining bright-- / Sweet dreams, my darling, sleep well . . . / good night!"" Ages 2-6. <BR>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.,PreSchool-Grade 2-Charming illustrations and comfortable rhymes characterize this appealing bedtime book. A twilight mood is set by dusky endpapers sprinkled with twinkling yellow stars, and by a title page showing a mother reading to a child. Double-page spreads feature animal pairs, each with a parent settling its offspring down for the night. An orange tabby kitten receives a soothing bath, a sleepy blue bird is tucked into a warm nest, and a delicate fawn curls up against its mother. Each babe is lulled by a gently rhyming couplet beginning with the phrase, ""It's time for bed."" Dyer's watercolor illustrations are dear. Large, clearly drawn animals are placed against backgrounds of vivid hues. A variety of landscapes keeps each scene looking fresh as a foal settles down in a moonlit meadow, a pair of fish blow bubbles in blue water, and two snakes curl up in overgrown grass. Working beautifully with the soothingly repetitive text, each painting conveys a warm feeling of safety and affection. A wonderful bedfellow for Ginsburg's Asleep, Asleep (Greenwillow, 1992).<BR><I>Joy Fleishhacker, New York Public Library</I><BR>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc."

She has written over 100 books that have been translated into 31 different languages, and over 10 million copies of her books have been sold worldwide. After graduating with an MBA from Harvard Business School, Lillian went on to pursue a highly successful business career in banking and finance in the 1980's in Hong Kong. Her business acumen, drive and abundant energy soon led her from the finance world to the world of luxury department stores and boutiques where, through a leveraged buy out, she became Chairman and shareholder of The Dragon Seed Group. All the while she was guided and taught by her feng shui masters in Hong Kong and China - and she attributes much of her monumental and quick rise to success in Hong Kong directly to them. Lillian soon decided to retire from active corporate life and return to Malaysia to raise her beautiful daughter, Jennifer, and spend more time with her family. It was at this time she began to devote her energy to writing and furthering her study of feng shui. She published her first book in Malaysia in1995 that quickly became a best seller and the rest is history. Today she is Chairman of Wofs.Com, a feng shui franchise and merchandising company run by her daughter, Jennifer Too. She trains feng shui students and future consultants at her Certified Consulting Institute in Malaysia and is much loved by her readers, associates and students for the way she teaches practical feng shui in a user-friendly way, using ordinary situations and circumstances that interest people and affect their everyday lives. In November 2009, at the International Feng Shui Convention in Singapore, the well-deserved title of GRAND MASTER OF FENG SHUI was conferred upon Lillian Too. Immediately following this accolade, in early January 2010, she received the prestigious Brand Laureate Personality of The Year Award presented by the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia! There seems to be no stopping her popularity and recognition these days! Lillian believes everyone should know her secrets and learn how to adapt feng shui to modern life.,,"

None of the popular English translations of the Qur'an were done by a scholar in traditional Islamic sciences. Mufti Muhammad Taqi Usmani, a renowned Islamic scholar who has been involved in studying and teaching Islamic sciences for more than half a century, has now filled this void. A brief introduction of each surah has been added wherever necessary. The respected author has also added explanatory notes to facilitate understanding of the text for the common reader.

Increased activity in this field is needed, particularly among the developing nations, in order to give another dimension to the funding and growth of their economies. Rice &amp; Chips makes a valuable contribution by promoting venture capital in Asia, keeping it in the awareness of relevant people and showing what is being done in other countries."" --Guillermo D. Luchangco, Chairman &amp; CEO, Investment and Capital Corporation of the Philippines (ICCP) Group<br /><br />""Posadas makes a strong case for geographic proximity among universities, research institutes and industry as instrumental for the proliferation of start-ups emerging out of Silicon Valley, Route 128 and similar Asian nodes of technopreneurship. When we look at our ivory-towered universities and their isolation from the enclave economies in our industrial estates, it is obvious that location strategy has been driven by the economics of transportation of infrastructure, of real estate development and of tax/fiscal incentives and that the factors of synergy and complementation have been all but forgotten. --Federico C Gonzalez, President/CEO, PESO Inc.,Dennis Posadas writes a technology column for the Philippine newspaper BusinessWorld. He has contributed several articles to UCLA AsiaMedia on Asian telecom, wireless and internet developments, and has been quoted by BusinessWeek regarding his views on Asian technopreneurship. Posadas has also acted as a consultant for the University of the Philippines Ayala Science and Technology Park. Posadas spent several years in the chip industry, mainly as a development engineer, technology business analyst and venture capital scout for Intel. He received his BS Electrical Engineering degree from the University of the Philippines at Diliman in 1991, and was a Fellow (Advanced Study Program) of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1999.

Her work is intensely personal, but the subject becomes an intimate of both audience and artist. Peyton's ability to draw the viewer in is a result of her own fascination and curiosity about the figures she chooses. They are stylish in a timeless way and are at moments in their lives when they stand for their own ideals of independence, beauty, and artistry.

There are true wonders to be observed from the window of the aeroplane, during a leisurely walk on the beach, or with a simple mask and snorkel. I hope that this book brings pleasure and happy memories to those who have stayed here, and entices new people to discover Los Roques. However, my greatest aim is to contribute to the care and conservation of this worldly paradise by enhancing the understanding of its rich ecology. Los Roques is a gift for us to enjoy, and it is our responsibility to protect and preserve it. Each shell and every grain of sand found in this paradise comes from the heart of the Caribbean. It belongs to the archipelago, and there it must remain. <br />"

Who is Tracy Morgan? The wildly unpredictable funnyman who rocketed to fame on Saturday Night Live? The Emmy-nominated actor behind the sly and ingenious character Tracy Jordan on the award-winning hit sitcom 30 Rock, whose turbulent personal life often mirrors that of his fictional alter ego? Is he Chico Divine, the life of the partyany party, anytime, anywheregetting ladies pregnant everywhere he goes? Or is he a soulful, tender family man who emerged from a hardscrabble ghetto upbringing and, against all odds, achieved superstardom, raised a solid family, prevailed over a collection of lethal bad habits, and is still ascending new heights and coming into his own? The answer is: Tracy Morgan is all that. And a bag of potato chips with a 50 soda.

When he was just a boy living in the Tompkins Projects in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, being funny was about survival. With the right snap, Tracy could shut down the playground bullies who picked on him and his physically disabled older brother. And with a wild enough prank, he could exact revenge on whoever stole his Pumas at the community pool. Later, being funny was about escapefrom the untouchable sadness of his father's death, from the desperation of the drug dealer's trade, from the life-and-death battles waged on the streets of the South Bronx in the age of crack. But these days being funny is about living his dreama dream born in the comedy clubs of Harlem and realized on shows like Martin and Saturday Night Live, where he was a cast member for seven years, and in movies like The Longest Yard and Half-Baked."

Religious scriptures the world over claim that one<br />or the other god made man, but science has not yet identified any supernatural<br />power that created and governed human beings. Was it man who came up with the<br />idea of gods to help him cope with his own fears? Could it be that ancient<br />people attributed natural phenomena-unfathomable and frightening to them-to the<br />working of invisible gods?<br /><br /><br /><br />What kind of<br />suffering or bewilderment made people bow before unseen powers or gods as we<br />call them? When were these gods created? Who invented morals and methods of<br />worship? Who wrote the ancient scriptures such as the Bible and the Vedas? Most<br />crucially, have gods and the scriptures shaped our responses to the world<br />around us?<br /><br /><br /><br />The Evolution of Gods seeks to answer these questions,<br />and explains scientifically how, when and why religions and gods came into<br />being. Ajay Kansal marshals anthropological and<br />historical facts about the development of religions in a simple and<br />straightforward manner to assert that it was mankind that created gods, and not<br />the other way around.<br /><br /><br /><br />About the Author<br /><br /><br /><br />Dr Ajay Kansal is a professor and consultant pathologist. It was<br />during his medical practice that he encountered human suffering in a big way<br />that made him question the concept of gods and drove him to write this <br /><br />book.<br /><br /><br /><br />Preface<br /><br /><br /><br />Today we are<br />all aware of the achievement of science.

You do not need to read music, or to learn to read it in order to play American folk guitar. The country boys who developed the guitar styles couldn't read. They played by ear. It is my object here to help you to join them in playing their hoe-downs, ballads and blues just as quickly as possible. In the following pages you will find the chords you need. More importantly, you will find explicit instructions on the ""licks"" or right hand techniques that give American or any guitar style its special colour. When you have worked through these pages---a process that might take you a month---or a couple of years, depending on how much time you can give the job---you will probably not be able to play like Pete Seeger or Lead Belly or Josh White or The Carter Family. But you will be in a position to learn how to play as well, or to develop your own style, based upon authentic materials."" [from foreword by Alan Lomax] ""Contents: I.

In this breathtaking and beautiful novel, the #1 New York Times bestselling author Anna Quindlen creates an unforgettable portrait of a mother, a father, a family, and the explosive, violent consequences of what seem like inconsequential actions.

 

Mary Beth Latham has built her life around her family, around caring for her three teenage children and preserving the rituals of their daily life. When one of her sons becomes depressed, Mary Beth focuses on him, only to be blindsided by a shocking act of violence. What happens afterwards is a testament to the power of a woman's love and determination, and to the invisible lines of hope and healing that connect one human being with another. Ultimately, as rendered in Anna Quindlen's mesmerizing prose, Every Last One is a novel about facing every last one of the things we fear most, about finding ways to navigate a road we never intended to travel, and about living a life we never dreamed we'd have to live, but find ourselves brave enough to try."

She has written over 100 books that have been translated into 31 different languages, and over 10 million copies of her books have been sold worldwide. After graduating with an MBA from Harvard Business School, Lillian went on to pursue a highly successful business career in banking and finance in the 1980's in Hong Kong. Her business acumen, drive and abundant energy soon led her from the finance world to the world of luxury department stores and boutiques where, through a leveraged buy out, she became Chairman and shareholder of The Dragon Seed Group. All the while she was guided and taught by her feng shui masters in Hong Kong and China - and she attributes much of her monumental and quick rise to success in Hong Kong directly to them. Lillian soon decided to retire from active corporate life and return to Malaysia to raise her beautiful daughter, Jennifer, and spend more time with her family. It was at this time she began to devote her energy to writing and furthering her study of feng shui. She published her first book in Malaysia in1995 that quickly became a best seller and the rest is history. Today she is Chairman of Wofs.Com, a feng shui franchise and merchandising company run by her daughter, Jennifer Too. She trains feng shui students and future consultants at her Certified Consulting Institute in Malaysia and is much loved by her readers, associates and students for the way she teaches practical feng shui in a user-friendly way, using ordinary situations and circumstances that interest people and affect their everyday lives. In November 2009, at the International Feng Shui Convention in Singapore, the well-deserved title of GRAND MASTER OF FENG SHUI was conferred upon Lillian Too. Immediately following this accolade, in early January 2010, she received the prestigious Brand Laureate Personality of The Year Award presented by the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia! There seems to be no stopping her popularity and recognition these days! Lillian believes everyone should know her secrets and learn how to adapt feng shui to modern life.,,"

Jackson gained notoriety shortly before his death in 1970 when his younger brother unsuccessfully tried to free him at gunpoint when Jackson and two others were on trial for killing a guard. Written between 1964 and 1970 while serving time in Soledad Prison for robbery, the letters reveal the brutality and racism faced by prisoners and call for unity among African Americans. This edition contains a new foreword by Jackson's nephew Jonathan. Soledad Brother remains ""recommended for most libraries"" (LJ 12/15/70) and is a solid title for Black History Month in February.

It chronicles the discovery of oil and gas and the development of the oil and gas industry in West Virginia and Southeastern Ohio from the mid-Eighteenth Century.

It delves into the powerful political influence that the industry leaders had on the creation of the state of West Virginia in the midst of the turmoil of the Civil War. It shows the importance of the Parkersburg area and West Virginia in the development of the world's most powerful and significant industries. The industry revolutionized modern history - from the kerosene light to modern plastics (for which the mid-Ohio valley is now famous). The amount of money involved is almost beyond comprehension when oil-related transactions of the 1800's are translated into today's dollar equivalents.

The book points out the influence of the area and its people on some of the most powerful companies in the world, including Standard Oil and EXXON, Marathon, Pure Oil, Cabot, Pennzoil, and Union Carbide, to name a few.

It is fully illustrated with over 270 pictures and maps - many never before published - and contains much original historical material with insightful analysis covering a range of political, social and economics events from the early 1800's to the present. Original material from newspapers, deeds and personal diaries provide a vivid portrait of the early days of the area.

This is a particularly important oilfield and local West Virginia history reference work containing many carefully researched facts which revise long accepted views of historical, political, social and economic events. Much of this new information has national implications."

There appeared a great man descending on a cloud, jump-roping into the Kingdom of Boxing, and Ali is portrayed running alongside a fifties Cadillac in a driving rain. All of Alis considerablecharisma isvividly captured byRocas oil paintingswe see Ali both leading groups of people and facing off in the ring, and always he has that gleam in his eye that could be mischievous or turnmalignant. As it tells the story of Alis career, culminating with his triumph in the Rumble in the Jungle, this book skillfully introduces young readers not only to Alis career and life story but also to his significance.

Besides this, he is the founder of Make Something!, a nationwide art education program for teens which partners world-renowned creative personalities with young aspiring artists. <br />The artist, born 1969 in Oregon, believes that life is nothing more than a dictionary of symbols: We look to symbols everywhere to help us make sense of our existence. From the mundane to the mystical symbols are totems that give order to the chaos and also help define ourselves as a tribe. From his very first works, symbolism has always played a major role. However, rather than use symbols for their intended significance, Aaron Rose always preferred to re-contextualise meanings in unexpected ways  creating abstract visuals composed of symbols invented and culled from the annals of visual history. Typography and hand-lettering has also played a big role in his work. <br />While living in New York in his early twenties, Rose supplemented his income working as a sign painter on the Lower East Side. The artists current series of works takes this a step further. The abstraction of symbols has been pushed a step further to create figurative portraits."

The Combat Engineer Vehicle, Full Tracked M728 based on the M60 was also fielded by US Armed Forces. The M60 was the first tank designated as MBT from the start and fielded by the US Army. It also was the last of the so-called Patton' tanks named after General George S. Patton, Jr. and the last vehicle of its kind fielded by the US Armed Forces featuring a cast hull and turret.

Employing easily understood and often quite beautiful line drawings, Salvadori traces architecture from prehistory through the Pyramids and Gothic cathedrals to sports arenas and hanging- dish roofs. It is a commonplace that every structure, from home to church to school to jail, sends a message to the onlooker. Salvadori argues that ""structure too has a message of its own: it can be a message of strength or elegance, of waste or economy, of ugliness or beauty."" Luckily, these days in architecture the consumer is being consulted in the design stage of product development. By paying attention to the laws of structure, the active citizen-consumer can affect the development of cities, buildings, parks and monuments."

In archeology a find of pottery or even an ancient city is all the more exciting because we learn something new about our human heritage. In Worlds Lost and Found we go with the men who search for lost worlds. We discover with them the clues to the past, the methods of archeology and the lost worlds themselves  who lived there and what they did. Here are thirteen stories  ranging from the chance discovery of the Rosetta Stone by one of Napoleons soldiers to an account of modern techniques of underwater archeology. We see the scientists at work, the slim clues they started with, the first finds, and then the completed arch of knowledge bridging the present and the once lost past. Adventure and knowledge are closely allied for the archeologist, and both can be enjoyed by the reader of Worlds Lost and Found. [Ages 12 and up],,"

Instead he argues that, because Milton recounts the difficult first chapters of Genesis at such length and in such imaginative detail, he disconcerts his readers. Milton's poetic power gives Adam and Eve at the moment of the Fall such human attractiveness that it is impossible to condemn them. The magnificent figure of Satan is consistently more appealing than Milton's God; and by a fatal lack of literary tact God is presented directly and quoted at length. This leads Milton into absurd literalisms and sometimes into evasiveness and self-contradiction and produces a conflict between what Milton meant to do and what the poem actually does. Professor Waldock's witty critical arguments appeal to the reader's direct and unprompted response to the poetry."

Utterly unprepared for the emergency C-section of the seven-week-early preemies, Groneberg and her writer husband, Tom, the parents of a four-year-old, are devastated by the news about Avery, and they must gradually alter their easygoing future plans about raising their kids. They reject the notion of adoption, suggested by a well-intentioned nurse at the hospital where the babies are ensconced in the neonatal intensive-care unit, and embark on an exhaustively trying, ultimately enlightening journey to care for the needy babies, especially Avery, and educate themselves about his condition. Rising from the shame of feeling that their family is broken, and letting slide hurtful comments by a grocery-store clerk or neighbor, Groneberg devoured books and information from the Internet, and began to foster their son's development by seeking out physical therapists and specialists. Small gains in Avery's motor skills were causes for celebration, and the beginning of speech the greatest gift the parents could ask for. Groneberg affectingly delineates these gradual, hard-won stages during Avery's first year toward love and acceptance. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br />Copyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,Rich with honesty, wisdom, and a deep appreciation for every day miracles, <i>Road Map to Holland </i>is a thoughtful, moving meditation on the struggles and joys Jennifer Graf Groneberg and her family experienced during her son Averys first two years. Groneberg offers a wealth of insight, information, and even practical resources for families whose children have Down syndrome. Yet this book is first and foremost a story about the constant discovery of love, and it will resonate with every reader who has traveled the always unpredictable, often overwhelming, wonder-filled journey into parenthood. <br />Kim Edwards, author of <i>The Memory Keepers Daughter</i> <br /><br /> I have been to Holland for eighteen years now, and this book brought back so many thoughts and feelings I had saved up that I felt an immediate sisterhood with Jennifer. I watched her deal with that same fear of the unknown that singed my heart, and I wept when she reached that crucial moment when she found that same place of self-forgiveness. No matter who or where you are in relation to a child with Down syndrome, these pages will be like signposts along your road, to give hope and a new way of seeing things. Its good to be able to see the potholes coming and be ready for them, and its good to know when to pull over and take the time to enjoy the breathtaking views that only happen on this road. Thank goodness for road maps! <br />Martha Sears, coauthor, <i>The Baby Book: Everything You Need to Know About Your Baby From Birth to Age Two</i> and author, <i>25 Things Every New Mother Should Know</i> <br /><br /> What a remarkable book! With excruciating candor and exquisite generosity, Jennifer Graf Groneberg invites us into the deepest privacy of her innermost thoughts, feelings, fears, challenges and triumphs. Nothing is left out in this amazingly intimate and profound journal. She allows us into every nook and cranny of her life and we find ourselves firmly ensconced in her heart. <br />Emily Perl Kingsley, national spokesperson and advocate for people with disabilities and author of <i>""Welcome to Holland""</i> <br /><br /> This is the story of Averya child with Down syndrome who transformed his mothers broken heart into one filled with cheer, awe, and pride. He offers all new and expectant parents a powerful perspective on lifes greatest lessons. <br />Brian Skotko, M.D., M.P.P., Childrens Hospital Boston &amp; Boston Medical Center. <br /><br /> Bursting with hope, Gronebergs account of mothering Avery highlights the triumph of love over fear. Its candid, vivid prose and poignant emotion make the story is difficult to put down and impossible to forget. Herein lies truth to be pondered and savored by every mother, every woman, every human being. <br />Kathryn Lynard Soper, editor of <i>Gifts: Mothers Reflect on How Children with Down Syndrome Enrich Their Lives </i>,,"

Jim Marrs, New York Times bestselling author of Crossfire
Richard Belzer and David Wayne are back to set the record straight after Dead Wrong; this time theyre going to uncover the truth about the many witness deaths tied to the JFK assassination. For decades, government pundits have dismissed these coincidental deaths, even regarding them as myths as urban legends.

Like most people, Richard and David were initially unsure about what to make of these coincidences. After all, events dont consult the odds prior to happening; they simply happen. Then someone comes along later and figures out what the odds of it happening were. Some of the deaths seemed purely coincidental; heart attacks, hunting accidents. Others clearly seemed noteworthy; witnesses who did seem to know something and did seem to die mysteriously.

Hit List is a fair examination of the evidence of each case, leading to (necessarily) different conclusions. The findings were absolutely staggering; as some cases were clearly linked to a clean-up operation after the murder of President Kennedy, while others were the result of other forces. The impeccable research and writing of Richard Belzer and David Wayne show that if the government is trying to hide anything, theyre the duo who will uncover it.

Romanus; Riley Sunderland,"5,522,571 in Books (",[],Books,187.38,B001HBSRDI,"{'Publisher:': 'Office of the Chief of Military History; First Edition edition (1953)', 'ASIN:': 'B001HBSRDI'}","Reading the history of the China-Burma-India Theater will be an eye opener and a lesson to those who, in the future, have to deal with allies in far distant lands about whom so much should be known and so little is.

Contemporary history is limited in its vision, as indeed is all history, insofar as the records are limited. This history is no exception; the records used are mainly of U.S. Army origin. However, time flies and experience of the past is essential to wisdom in the future. To wait for additional evidence might deny pertinent information to those who need it now. Moreover, the records turned up by the authors of this book are exceptionally rich.

A careful reading of this volume will emphasize the necessity on the part of the leading participants in a combined venture to understand the characteristics and over-all objectives of the nations as well as the individuals concerned in the endeavor. If such an understanding is present, and if due weight is given it by those involved in negotiations as well as in the execution of the plans, the better will be the result. The degree to which this understanding was achieved by the leading participants is left for the reader to decide.

Decisions, to be sound, must perforce be based on up-to-date facts. The danger of making them from information supplied from not too well informed sources, and without information that could readily have been brought to bear, is self-evident.

While still in the service, the authors were sent to Asia in the summer of 1945 to join the Historical Sections of the India-Burma and the China Theaters. Riley Sunderland went to New Delhi, India, and Charles F. Romanus to Chungking, China. Each spent about a year in his respective post before work was begun on this volume.

[],When God comes alive through the Spirit-renewed church,[],Lance Webb,"20,733,017 in Books (",[],Books,7.56,B0006BU2M4,"{'Hardcover:': '223 pages', 'Publisher:': 'Abingdon Press; 1St Edition edition (1968)', 'Language:': 'English', 'ASIN:': 'B0006BU2M4', '\n    Package Dimensions: \n    ': '8.5 x 5.7 x 0.9 inches', 'Shipping Weight:': '14.4 ounces'}","Can God come alive in my own life? In my church? In the world around me? Lance Webb believes that he can. And here he indicates clearly and persuasively how God DOES come alive in persons and in society through the Spirit-renewed church. His main thesis is that personal and church renewal comes with the Holy Spirit becomes real in experience of people rather than merely through changing words, forms, and structures in the church. ""New and more vital forms of worship, theology, community, morality, ministry, and structure are required for the church to be fully relevant for the space age; but the new forms and structures are the results of the Spirit's renewal and not the cause."" Bishop Webb deals directly with Spirit renewed worship, theology, community, mission, evangelism, ministry, and joy in living. He fills his writing with illustrations from contemporary problems and provides a sharp cutting edge to challenge the reader to decision. Here is a convincing word concerning the living God so desperately needed in our complex and combustible world. This book is designed to meet the needs of two distinct groups of readers (1) Secularists both in and out of the church whose need can be met by sharing the witness of vital persons and movements in history and our own time. (2) Committed Christians who seek a better understanding of the ways in which their personal and group participation in the church may be made more effective. All will be impressed with the way in which Bishop Webb uses the witness of experience to point ways in which present renewal may come and has come. ""Spirit-filled worship makes us conscious of our own self centered poverty and lack, gives us a wealth of new joy and life, and sends us out to share the good news with all who recognize their poverty and lack."" ""Our theology must be Spirit-renewed; that is, it must be more than an acceptance of words."",,"

From a succession of sales gurus he learns the One Minute secret-it's not selling, it's ""helping people...to feel good about what they buy."" Johnson, author of the business mega-seller Who Moved My Cheese?, offers practical suggestions ranging from sensible (treat customers like people, listen carefully to their needs, use after-sale calls to generate good will and referrals) to questionable (use one-minute positive-thinking rituals to visualize successful sales calls) to sort of depressing (paste sales goals beside your shaving mirror). The ""eighty/twenty rule"" is paramount: ""Eighty percent of our results are produced by about twenty percent of what we do."" Unfortunately, the book embodies this rule a little too well: about twenty percent is truly solid advice, while eighty percent feels more like filler (""The man took out his notebook to record what he sensed was going to be useful information"") padded further with extra-large type. <BR>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.,,In this newly released edition of one of his classic books, <em>The One Minute Sales Person,</em> Spencer Johnson, the author of the number one New York Times bestseller <em>Who Moved My Cheese?, </em>shows you how to sell your ideas, products, or services successfully!

You will learn how to enjoy your job and your life more as you discover the effective secrets of ""self-management,"" the integrity of ""selling on purpose,"" and the liberating ""wonderful paradox"" of helping others get what they want so you can get what you need.,<em>The One Minute Sales Person</em> is a clear, easy and invaluable guide that works for both you and the people you sell to, for your financial prosperity and personal well-being.,In short, it is a classic Spencer Johnson bestseller that can help you enjoy more success with less stress."

He served as the bishop of Lublin from 1946 to 1948, archbishop of Warsaw and archbishop of Gniezno from 1948 to 1981. He was created cardinal on 12 January 1953 by Pope Pius XII. He assumed the title of Primate of Poland. Stefan Wyszyski was often called the Primate of the Millennium. The case for his beatification and canonization opened in 1989 (now has the title of Servant of God) and has many proponents in the Vatican and in his native Poland, where he is well known for his heroic and principled stand against Nazism and Communism and because of his connections to Pope John Paul II (he ultimately urged then-Cardinal Wojtyla to accept his election as Supreme Pontiff). He was the unquestionable leader of Polish nation (the non-crowned king of Poland), in opposition to the totalitarian government that was dependent on the Soviet Union. He is widely believed to be responsible for the survival of Polish Christianity under the highly unfavorable circumstances. He was imprisoned for three years by the Communists, and is commonly considered as a Polish national hero. This book is a rich collection drawn from the sermons and addresses by Wyszynski, a Churchman in the great tradition, a spiritual leader and a teacher of John Paul the Great. The Cardinal here speaks to his people, and, though them, to the world: ""Poles know how to die wonderfully. But, my children, it is also necessary that Poles know how to live wonderfully. One dies only once, and becomes famous quickly. But one lives in difficulties, in pain, in suffering, in sorrow, for many years. And this is the greatest heroism in the present time"".

All you have to do is continue the same Maltese classes or reading material that youre studying now and listen to this CD to accelerate your learning ability. It wont teach, but it will turn you into an Maltese learning machine.
This CD contains 6 ten minute subliminal sessions to choose from. Each session contains the same subliminal suggestions carefully crafted by hypnotist Alex Armani, CHT. You get to choose which track(s) to listen to!
Successful people across the world are using subliminal programming to help them correct bad habits, improve their health, and acquire new languages faster than ever possible before. Subliminal programming means you will hear NO AUDIBLE VOICE because it has been masked in order to bypass your conscious filters. This gives the suggestions the ability to directly impact your subconscious mind for maximum impact.

He spent his young life in search of a medium with which to express and develop his aesthetic. He was interested in social reform, and explored music, literature, and poetry. The gift of a camera in 1930 changed his life forever. His early images were powerful evocations of the human condition, many of them done under the auspices of the New York Photo League. Beginning in the 1940's, Aaron's imagery shifted from subject and description to symbol and form. By the 1950's, this symbol and form, abstraction from a context combined with a passion for surface and texture came to identify the pictorial language of Aaron Siskind. This was his mature artistic voice and this is the work for which he is most celebrated today. Siskind explored great themes of art and literature in the photographic vernacular he invented, an idiom related to the explorations of painters Willem DeKooning and Mark Rothko.

His personal magnetism, his smile, uncluttered idealism, and his overwhelming vitality made him a hero in his time and a legend in the years afterward. The purpose of this book is to explore that legend and to extract from it a real, breathing, flesh and blood man - a man of a thousand moods, a saint and a sinner - but most of all human. By the time you have read this vivid, intimate biography and scanned the fascinating photographs, you will have read Villa's actual words, the words of his close friends, his wives, his mistresses and his bitterest enemies. From these heretofore untapped sources there emerges a probing portrait of a poverty stricken peasant who could raise vast armies literally out of the earth. A lusty soldier who created an international incident by kidnapping a beautiful but unwilling French girl to be his wife. A desperate outlaw who was chased by over 20,000 American soldiers, was never caught, yet at times could have reached out and touched his pursuers. Equally fascinating is he story of Villa's famous butcher, Fierro. Fierro's sabre and pistol represented the only law he knew. Here, in graphic detail, is the full account of the day The Butcher shot 300 men, at one time, then calmly rolled over and went to sleep. Pancho Villa, his revolution, his armies, his innovations to modern warfare, his friends have all been the subject of both denigration and admiration, depending from which side of the fence they have been viewed. Here, for the first time anywhere, the man and his cause have been successfully extracted from hyperbole and fantasy.. The resultant distillation is guaranteed to provide hours of fast-paced, absorbing reading."

This biography includes many never published photos from the guitarists private collection  More than 400 illustrations including 150 photos never published. Tal Farlow, ever the reluctant star, was, nevertheless, one of the best guitarists in the history of jazz. Charlie Christian and Art Tatum were his early influences, but later meetings with Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gilespie and Bud Powell, brought him firmly into the bebop fold. There, he developed his own very personal style. Though a self-taugh guitarist, he was nonetheless an exceptional virtuoso, endowed with a great sense of harmony and an unlimited melodic imagination. These talents secured his place as one of the seminal guitarists of the 20th century. This biography also includes a CD of recorded interviews by the artist as well as tracks whim him playing at home with fellow guitarist and close friend, Jimmy Raney and bassist, Red Mitchell.

The author depicts the court which ruled the largest empire ever to appear in Southeast Asia in a believable and accurate way. I hope that this novel will attract more people to learn about the fascinating history of this region. --Dr John N. Miksic- Associate Professor, Department of Southeast Asian Studies, National University of Singapore<br /><br />Earl Drake draws a lively picture of one of the most crucial periods in ancient Indonesian history, the Hindu Buddhist Majapahit kingdom, which was centred in East Java and which ruled over most of what is today Indonesia. The reader will be attracted by the narration about a fascinating woman, Gayatri Rajapatni, who had an important role in the Majapahit dynasty during its early period and its heyday in the fourteenth century. By enriching the frame of historical facts through his empathetic imagination, the author unfolds in his novel a story of politics and love, warfare and peace, religion and art, and daily life at court. Earl Drake interprets the beautiful statue of Prajnaparamita, one of the major relics from ancient Javanese art kept in the National Museum in Jakarta, as a depiction of Gayatri. Thus, the enormous veneration of Gayatri, which is documented in the Nagarakrtagama, the poetic hymn on King Hayam Wuruk of Majapahit, equals the worship of Prajnaparamita, the Buddhist Goddess of Higher Wisdom. According to local legend the statue represents Ken Dedes, a queen of the earlier Singhasari period. The historical novel sheds new light and delivers new suggestions in the still-ongoing scholarly discussion about the meaning of the Prajnaparamita image, by taking a new look at both the image of an outstanding statue and an outstanding person. --Dr Lydia Kieven- Lecturer, Department of Southeast Asian Studies, GoetheUniversit&#xE4;t Frankfurt am Main<br /><br />This work transports us to an exposition of a historical figure who was instrumental in the rise of a dynasty which became the largest imperium in the Nusantara. With an attractive narrative and the use of primary sources on Majapahit such as Nagarakrtagama and Pararaton, this book is most suitable as an introduction for all those who are interested in the classical period of Asia. --Adrian Perkasa- Executive Director, Indonesian Heritage Trust,Earl Drake spent most of his long career as a diplomat trying to promote cooperation and understanding between Canada and other countries, mostly in Asia. He gradually worked his way up from mid-rank assignments in Pakistan, Malaysia and Burma to senior positions as Canada s Executive Director at the World Bank in Washington and then as Ambassador, first to Indonesia and later to China. During his international career, he never forgot his academic training in history and his early days as a university lecturer, an archivist, and a commissioned author of a civic history book. After retiring from Canada s Foreign Service in 1992, he took up new positions initially at Vancouver s Simon Fraser University and later at the University of British Columbia. These have enabled him to combine his interest in history with his career focus on fostering Western understanding of Asia."

It is a cyclopedia of firearms makers of both long and short arms, custom made and arms made under federal and state government contracts. It covers the period from the Colonial era and to the end of the 19th century. AMERICAN FIREARMS MAKERS contains more than 2,000 entries arranged in alphabetical order from Andrew Agnew to John Zuendorff. All the great makers, such as Cold, Deringer, Drepperd, Pomeroy, Whitney, etc., have considerable material to cover a complete summary of their activities and their place in American firearms history, not to mention the hundreds and hundreds of other makers whose names maybe puzzling to collectors. Each entry will tell you the correct spelling of the maker's name, the span of years he was active, the town or city and state in which he was located, and the type of arms he produced. The data are concise; but, where it is appropriate, other information is abundantly supplied: patent dates, descriptive markings, calibers, and dimensions of the arms, etc. Other books have covered sections of the country and limited periods of the subject's history. This is the first book to cover the entire U. S. during the flintlock, percussion, and metallic-cartridge cycles of arms.

And while the origin of split basketry is somewhat obscure, a popular belief has it that these techniques have their roots in Scandinavia and were taken by the Viking invaders to the British Isles in the seventh and eighth centuries. There had long been a tradition of basketry in early England and through the years there occurred a mingling and perfecting of skills. The product of the combination was brought to this country in the 1700's by the early Scotch-Irish immigrants who settled in the hill country of the Appalachians. Those persons accustomed to this type of craft soon recognized that the quality and quantity of white oak available was readily adaptable to the making of splits and split basketry.
They set about producing split oak baskets modeled after old country styles. There were no brown paper sacks, no plastic pails or cardboard boxes at this time. Baskets were the containers of the day; strong, light, durable, and very much in demand. They were utilitarian baskets to hold the ""fruits"" of man's labor, to gather the foodstuffs made available by nature and to be used throughout the frontier household for storage, measuring, and at times, to barter or turn into cash. Wherever there was a need, there was a style to fit the need.
With the coming of the twentieth century and a movement toward more modern lifestyles, who would continue to build baskets the ""hard way"" when a trip to the store would yield inexpensive containers of metal or synthetics with which to ""tote and fetch""? So it was that the basket craft took a downward turn, relegated to a nearly forgotten skill until more recent times with the revival of some traditional folk ways."

The essays vary in usefulness and value, from Beatriz Colomina's pungent commentaries on modern housing prototypes presented at international exhibitions to Anthony Vidler's highly abstract treatment of the space-time continuum. The authors have taken pains to include as much regionalist material as possible; indeed, the character of modern architecture morphs from internationalism into regionalism under the impact of this fair-sized volume. The result is a more politically correct treatment of modern architecture. The catalog accompanies an exhibition of the same name that will appear at leading museums around the world over the next two years, but the text will limit the book's appeal to serious readers.?Peter S.

He has sold more than one hundred million copies. His last book, <i>World Without End</i>, went straight to the No. 1 position on bestseller lists in the United States, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France.,He first hit the charts in 1978 with <i>Eye of the Needle</i>, a taut and original thriller with a memorable woman character in the central role. The book won the Edgar Award and became an outstanding film starring Kate Nelligan and Donald Sutherland.,He went on to write four more bestselling thrillers: <i>Triple</i>, <i>The Key to Rebecca</i>, <i>The Man from St. Petersburg</i>, and <i>Lie Down with Lions</i>. Cliff Robertson and David Soul starred in the miniseries of <i>The Key to Rebecca</i>. In 1994 Timothy Dalton, Omar Sharif, and Marg Helgenberger starred in the miniseries of <i>Lie Down with Lions</i>.,He also wrote <i>On Wings of Eagles</i>, the true story of how two employees of Ross Perot were rescued from Iran during the revolution of 1979. This book was made into a miniseries with Richard Crenna as Ross Perot and Burt Lancaster as Colonel ""Bull"" Simons.,Ken Follett then surprised readers by radically changing course with <i>The Pillars of the Earth</i>, a novel about building a cathedral in the Middle Ages. Published in September 1989 to rave reviews, it was on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list for eighteen weeks. It also reached the No. 1 position on lists in Canada, Great Britain, and Italy, and was on the German bestseller list for six years. It was voted the third greatest book ever written by 250,000 viewers of the German television station ZDF in 2004, beaten only by <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and the Bible. When <i>The Times</i> (London) asked its readers to vote for the sixty greatest novels of the last sixty years, <i>The Pillars of the Earth</i> was placed at No. 2, after <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>. (The sequel, <i>World Without End</i>, was No. 23 on the same list.) In November 2007, Pillars became the most popular choice of the Oprah Winfrey Book Club, returning to No. 1 on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list. The miniseries, produced by Ridley Scott and starring Ian McShane and Matthew Macfadyen, is due for broadcast in 2010.,After <i>Pillars</i>, Ken Follett abandoned the straightforward spy genre for awhile, but his stories still had powerful narrative drive, strong women characters, and elements of suspense and intrigue. <i>Night over Water</i>, <i>A Dangerous Fortune</i>, and <i>A Place Called Freedom</i> followed.,Then he returned to the thriller. <i>The Third Twin</i> was a scorching suspense novel about a young woman scientist who stumbles across a secret experiment in genetic engineering. Miniseries rights were sold to CBS for $1,400,000, a record price for four hours of television. The series, starring Kelly McGillis and Larry Hagman, was broadcast in the United States in November 1997. (Ken Follett appeared briefly as the butler.) In <i>Publishing Trends'</i> annual survey of international fiction bestsellers for 1997, <i>The Third Twin</i> was ranked No. 2 in the world, beaten only by John Grisham's <i>The Partner</i>.,<i>The Hammer of Eden</i>, another nail&ndash;biting contemporary suspense story, came in 1998. <i>Code to Zero</i> (2000), about brainwashing and rocket science in the fifties, went to No. 1 on bestseller lists in the United States, Germany, and Italy, and film rights were snapped up by Doug Wick, producer of <i>Gladiator</i>, in a seven-figure deal. <i>Jackdaws</i> (2001), a World War II spy story in the tradition of <i>Eye of the Needle</i>, won the Corine Prize for 2003. Film rights were sold to Dino De Laurentiis. <i>Hornet Flight</i>, about two young people who escape from German&ndash;occupied Denmark in a Hornet Moth biplane, is loosely based on a true story. It was published in December 2002. <i>Whiteout</i>, a contemporary thriller about the theft of a dangerous virus from a laboratory, was published in 2004 and made into a miniseries in 2009.,<i>World Without End</i>, the long&ndash;awaited sequel to <i>The Pillars of the Earth</i>, was published in October 2007. It is set in Kingsbridge, the fictional location of the cathedral in <i>Pillars</i>, and features the descendants of the original characters at the time of the Black Death. It was a No.1 bestseller in Italy, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Spain, where it was the fastest&ndash;selling book ever published in the Spanish language, outstripping the last Harry Potter book.,A board game based on <i>The Pillars of the Earth</i> was released worldwide in 2007 &ndash; 2008 and won the following prizes: Deutscher Spielepreis 2007, Game of the Year 2007 in the United States (GAMES 100), Jeu d'annee 2007 (Canada), Juego del ano 2007 (Spain), Japan Boardgame Prize 2007, Arets Spill 2007 (Norway), and Spiele Hit 2007 (Austria).

Fort Sumter to Perryville
""Here, for a certainty, is one of the great historical narratives of our century, a unique and brilliant achievement, one that must be firmly placed in the ranks of the masters."" Van Allen Bradley, Chicago Daily News

""Anyone who wants to relive the Civil War, as thousands of Americans apparently do, will go through this volume with pleasure.... Years from now, Foote's monumental narrative most likely will continue to be read and remembered as a classic of its kind."" New York Herald Tribune Book Review

Fredericksburg to Meridian
""This, then, is narrative historya kind of history that goes back to an older literary tradition.... The writing is superb...one of the historical and literary achievements of our time."" The Washington Post Book World

""Gettysburg...is described with such meticulous attention to action, terrain, time, and the characters of the various commanders that I understand, at last, what happened in that battle.... Mr. Foote has an acute sense of the relative importance of events and a novelist's skill in directing the reader's attention to the men and the episodes that will influence the course of the whole war, without omitting items which are of momentary interest. His organization of facts could hardly be bettered."" Atlantic

Red River to Appomattox
""An unparalleled achievement, an American Iliad, a unique work uniting the scholarship of the historian and the high readability of the first-class novelist."" Walker Percy

""I have never read a better, more vivid, more understandable account of the savage battling between Grant's and Lee's armies"

Accompanying her is her boyfriend, with whom things are starting to go sour. When Trace finds out that her father is the producer/creator of teen sensation Kandy Kane, all of her punk roots rebel against the idea of associating with the pop princess. While the chick-lit genre has given readers a plethora of fun books, this one falls short. Trace is self-absorbed and overdrawn, the plot is predictable, and the ending wraps up way too neatly (especially considering all of the horrible things Trace does to her friends during the book). That said, the novel is part of a genre that attracts teen girls and will be enjoyed by a few undiscriminating readers.<I>&ndash;Rainey Wyatt, Louisville Free Public Library, KY</I> <BR>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And since medieval Europe was the cradle of modern Western society, this work is vital for understanding our world and how it came into being.
St.  Augustine is probably the most influential Christian thinker after St. Paul, and this book is his masterpiece, a vast synthesis of religious and secular knowledge.  It began as a reply to the charge that Christian other-wordliness was causing the decline of the Roman Empire.  Augustine produced a wealth of evidence to prove that paganism bore within itself the seeds of its own destruction.  Then he proceeded to his larger theme, a cosmic interpretation of history in terms of the struggle between good and evil:  the City of God in conflict with the Earthly City or the City of the Devil.  This, the first serious attempt at a philosophy of history, was to have incalculable influence in forming the Western mind on the relations of Church and State and on the Christian's place in the temporal order.
The original City of God contained twenty-two books and fills three regular-sized volumes.  This edition has been skillfullly abridged for the intelligent general reader by Vernon J. Bourke, author of Augustine's Quest for Wisdom.  The heart of this monumental work is now available to a much wider audience."

Scott Fitzgerald, John Dos Passos, e. e. cummings, Hart Crane, Djuna Barnes, Ezra Pound, and Gertrude Stein - the world of the Lost Generation and Les Deux Magots. <br><br>While in Paris she became very close friends with Gertrude Stein and her lover, Alice B. Toklas. In 1932 she fell in love with Noel Haskins Murphy, a singer from a village just outside Paris, and had a short-lived romance. <br><br>

She played a crucial role in introducing her contemporaries - or at least those who read the New Yorker - to new artists in Paris, including Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Henri Matisse, Andr Gide, Jean Cocteau, and the Ballets Russes, as well as crime passionel and vernissage, the triumphant crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by Charles Lindbergh and the depravities of the Stavisky Affair. <br><br>

In September 1925 Flanner published her first ""Letter from Paris"" in The New Yorker, launched the previous February, launching a professional association destined to last for five decades. Flanner had first came to the attention of editor Harold Ross through his first wife, Jane Grant, who was a friend of Flanner's from the Lucy Stone League, an organization that fought for women to preserve their maiden names after marriage. Flanner joined the group in 1921. Ross famously thought ""Gent"" was French for ""Janet"".

Her prose style has since come to epitomise the ""New Yorker style"" - its influence can be seen decades later in the prose of Bruce Chatwin. An example: ""The late Jean De Koven was an average American tourist in Paris but for two exceptions: she never set foot in the Opra, and she was murdered."""

And for almost as long they've been playing one continuous, ever-changing game--a game that takes place in a world populated with pirates and thieves, mermaids and warriors. Ruling over them all is the Great Queen, a bone-china doll imprisoned in a cabinet, cursing those who displease her. But the three friends are in middle school now, and Zach's father is pushing him to give up make-believe for basketball. When his father gives him no choice, Zach quits the game and lies about the reason. It seems like their friendship might be over, until Poppy declares she's been having dreams about the Queen--and the ghost of a girl who will not rest until the bone-china doll is buried in her empty grave. And so Zach and Alice and Poppy set off on one last adventure to lay the Queen's ghost to rest. But nothing goes according to plan, and as their adventure turns into an epic journey, creepy things begin to happen. Is the doll just a doll, or is there something more sinister at work? Has Poppy been telling the truth, or is she tricking them into playing a new game? And if there really is a ghost, will it let them go now that it has them in its clutches?"

That, by the way, is not Whitfield's cut-off point, it's mine. He soldiers bravely and chronologically through his leviathan list of poetic categories - medieval, Elizabethan, metaphysical, Cavalier, graveyard, Augustan, romantic, Hartford wits, Victorian, confessional, Georgian, war, modern, new apocalypse, postmodern, ending with performance poetry - but I incline to Macaulay's view that 'as civilisation advances, poetry almost necessarily declines'. Thomas Wyatt's poem in Songs and Sonnets, says Whitfield, shattered the medieval moral narrative tradition. Its title, The Lover Showeth How He Is Forsaken of Such as He Sometime Enjoyed, does not sound promising. Read on. 'They flee from me that sometime did me seek / With naked foot stalking in my chamber. / I have seen them gentle, tame and meek, / That now are wild, and do not once remember / That sometime they have put themselves in danger / To take bread at my hand; and now they range, / Busily seeking with a continual change. / Thank'd be fortune it hath been otherwise, / Twenty times better; but once especial, / In thin array, after a pleasant guise, / When her loose gown did from her shoulders fall, / And she me caught in her arms long and small, / Therewith all sweetly did me kiss, / And softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?' Sensuous, mysterious, intellectual and above all personal, this melodious crystallisation of emotion was like nothing previously classed as poetry and set the stage for the Elizabethan golden age. Thence to the whole glorious canon of poetic greats - Donne, Milton, Blake, Keats, Hopkins, Frost, Dickinson, Yeats and, yes, in my book, Stevens. If poetry truly is the alchemy of words and the music of ideas, he has to be in the premier league. 'The houses are haunted / By white night-gowns. / None are green, / Or purple with green rings, / Or green with yellow rings, /Or yellow with blue rings. / None of them are strange, / With socks of lace, / And beaded ceintures. / People are not going / To dream of baboons and periwinkles. / Only, here and there, an old sailor, / Drunk and asleep in his boots, / Catches tigers / In red weather.' Don't ask me what it means, just listen to it. Whitfield's history is less a textbook than a rough guide, but if his enthusiasm doesn't inspire you to buy a volume of Swinburne - aristo, atheist, aesthete, alcoholic, sadomasochist - I'll be surprised. --Sue Arnold, The Guardian<br /><br />Derek Jacobi brings this production together with a clear and lively narration of its introduction. The collection is a general presentation, rather than a scholarly tome, on the evolution of the idea of English poetry (and its American cousins and influences) and where readers fit into the tradition. In each era, the text addresses the question of what a poem was expected to be and do. These are illustrated by thoughtfully interpreted readings from works by more than a hundred poets by a group of skilled Naxos narrators. This critical history traces poets from Chaucer to Allen Ginsberg. --D.M.H., AudioFile<br /><br />For lovers of poetry, there is the excellent and fascinating audiobook, T<i>he History of English Poetry</i>, read by famous actor Derek Jacobi (think <i>Brother Cadfael</i> and <i>I, Claudius</i>). The original book was written by Peter Whitfield, whose sweeping command of the subject gives us a wonderful look into the rich and centuries' old tradition of English poetry from the earliest writers to the present. While Jacobi reads the bulk of the book in his mellifluous voice, other readers bring to life various poems quoted within it, thus giving this work authenticity and colour to hold the listener's interest. --Alide Kohlhaas, Seniors Review<br /><br />Derek Jacobi brings this production together with a clear and lively narration of its introduction.

Gaston particularly liked the Strawberry Lady and stole strawberries as often as he could. Strangely, Rosalie liked strawberries too.

Burroughs. For academics and fans alike, the archives of the pivotal beat triumvir of William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac have long been a source of fascination and a continued wealth of lost texts. Despite the excavation of a large number of letters and minor works, alongside significant manuscripts such as the Burroughs / Kerouac collaboration And the Hippos Were Boiled in their Tanks (written in 1945, but not published until 2010) there is nevertheless a sense that the well may be beginning to run dry. It is perhaps for this reason that interest in the extended Beat family tree which has branches that extend far and wide is finally beginning to grow. While largely (and unjustly) neglected thus far, the so-called European Beats made a substantial contribution to the dissemination of the cut-up method. Many of these writers were introduced to the technique by Burroughs himself through his many contributions to underground zines in the 1960s, when his project had been specifically to recruit practitioners far and wide in order to spread the virus and spearhead an assault against linguistic programming and rational thought. Amongst these, Carl Weissner, Claude Plieu and Mary Beach stand out for their contributions to the cut-up canon. Many of their works were produced with Burroughs direct involvement in some capacity: for example the Counterscripts which preface Plieus 1967 novel With Revolvers Aimed Finger Bowls, and Weissners The Braille Film (1970). These publications are relatively sought after and are commanding increasingly high prices on the collectors' market.

[],Grey ocean strategy: agewise marketing for the mature consumer,[],Edgar Keehnen,"7,475,231 in Books (",[],Books,87.27,9078094699,"{'Paperback:': '352 pages', 'Publisher:': 'Stili Novi Publishing; 1st edition (2015)', 'Language:': 'English', 'ISBN-10:': '9078094699', 'ISBN-13:': '978-9078094692', '\n    Product Dimensions: \n    ': '5.5 x 1.1 x 8.7 inches', 'Shipping Weight:': '1.5 pounds ('}","The demographic earthquake called aging: the huge increase in market potential caused by this force driving change requires all companies to reconsider their current strategies. It leads to the new market majority: mature consumers with different needs than younger people or similar needs but a different way of converting them into wants. How do we develop successful strategies to exploit the opportunities of aging as a key force driving change? The psychology of aging is the fundament of a Grey Ocean Strategy. We will describe the major changes that occur emotionally and cognitively when aging, leading to the seven soft spots of aging. Insights from scientific studies on aging will be synthesized and applied to real life to create, spread and realize the right value proposition for the mature consumer. We then need to understand the consumer decision proces in later life. Because mature consumers have been confronted with quite a number of offers during their lifetime that failed to deliver what they promised. That is why they look for the real thing. To reach the mature consumer, we have to change our marketing paradigms. The traditional marketing paradigms need to be changed into customer based marketing management, based on creating, spreading and realizing an innovative, authentic value proposition for the mature consumer. This textbook clearly describes how to develop a successful Grey Ocean Strategy. Life before 50 is nothing but a warm-up. A Grey Ocean Strategy, based on the Grey Ocean Blueprint, described in the last chapter, will help you to add value to life of the mature consumer and to your own business.,,"

Provisions govern installation, inspection, testing, maintenance, performance, and safe practices for facilities, material, equipment, and appliances -- including medical gas and vacuum systems formerly found in NFPA 99C. Major changes in the 2015 NFPA 99 make performance criteria more usable, enforceable, and adoptable. Other revisions respond to new information and the evolving industry.

McGraw-Hill purchased NRI and the correspondence division of Capitol Radio Engineering Institute in 1968, hoping to make a market for their text books and unaware that most correspondence schools wrote their own lessons. The school was renamed NRI Schools, McGraw-Hill Continuing education center. James E. Smith remained as NRI chairman until his death in 1973. James&apos; son, J Morrison Smith, succeeded as president, retiring in 1976. McGraw-Hill announced in 1999 that it would phase out NRI Schools, citing &quot;changes in the marketplace&quot;.

Grade 5-8&ndash;With plentiful, excellent-quality photographs, this highly visual book offers a behind-the-scenes look at an emergency animal hospital in Colorado. While a German shepherd's life is saved, a snake could not be resuscitated. The pictures work well with the smallish-print text. Photographs range from heartbreaking (the saddest-ever Basset hound) to heartwarming (Shelley, a dog recovering from HBC, or hit by a car in vet-speak) to somewhat graphic. There are examples of X-rays and action shots of surgeries. In a chapter on the history of vets and pets, readers learns about how, in 15th-century France, a sow and her piglets were put on trial for murdering a child. Source notes are appended. A section on grief counseling for families with critically ill pets and a spread on how to put together a pet first-aid kit are included. Well-researched and well-written, <I>ER Vets</I> is an engaging book on a hot topic.<I>&ndash;Anne Chapman Callaghan, Racine Public Library, WI</I> <BR>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,Gr. 5-8. A veteran nonfiction author as well as a pet owner, Jackson doesn't sidestep the emotional and physical demands of working in an emergency clinic, but her sensitive, behind-the-scenes look at emergency care also clearly shows the rewards of the profession and the bonds between owner and pet. To get the facts, she spent time in a-state-of-the-art facility, talking with vets, vet techs, pet owners, and even grief counselors, and observing a variety of animal patients--from a ball python, Lucy, that can't be saved, to a foal, Paco, born weak and tiny, that lives. The book's organization seems a little haphazard: while some chapters focus on particular animals, others are fairly general, and a few insets are sandwiched between the sections (for example, one discussing foods humans eat that can harm an animal). Still, Jackson gives both pets and their caregivers their due, and numerous, excellent photos, including a look at a surgery in progress, make this not only intriguing browsing material but also an honest initiation to a worthwhile career. A list of items for a pet first-aid kit is appended. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i><br><i>Copyright &#169; American Library Association. All rights reserved</i>"

Brief anecdotes by Oprah and recipe prefaces by Daley, her cook, may lure Oprah watchers--not only have they seen her weight loss, now they can taste the foods that presumably helped to make it possible. Others will find her style obvious: ""I have thrived on pasta,"" Oprah confides. ""I can eat it every day."" Exclamation points abound: ""Forget iceberg!"" she exhorts in the introduction to salad recipes.""Experiment! . . . Delicious!"" Fortunately, Daley is a professional chef, trained at the Cal-A-Vie Spa, and her recipes are no mere fluff. Practical advice on preparations that add flavor while reducing fat reflect her spa experience, while suggestions for garnishes add visual interest. The numerous tips stretch the length of the book, too: just 50 recipes are featured in 134 pages. Typical of Daley's approach is the following paean to paella: ""In this beautiful dish jet-black mussels, pale gray clams, and vibrant red lobster tails lie on a bed of golden saffron rice, surrounded by chopped tomato and green peas, its flavor enhanced by the addition of squid rings and an assortment of peppers.""

We four sisters have been performing our unique style of harmony for over thirty years. Though we have spent most of our lives singing together, we are also individuals with different personalities and separate achievements. If nothing else, this book serves as a testament to our parents and our families. It is intended for our audiences, those who have watched us growing up before their eyes on their television screens. Our memories have served us well, too. We tell as much as we are able. We are great talkers, and admittedly we've written as we speak. We're proud of our book. We're proud of ourselves for completing it. It has been good therapy, and after so many hours, days, weeks, and years, we are proud to say we are still friends. Finally, this is it! It is finished! It has been ours for years, Now it is yours."" From the rear cover: ""Maybe we took family attachment too far. But, in growing, we found ourselves drawing enormous strength from being together. I never realized it was so special. We are open to and experience changes. Sometimes the changes are abrupt and painful, other times subtle, many times joyful.....we are aware of our special bond."""

When the story opens, Rose is on the run from her past, but a chance encounter with a dying man changes her world forever. The man, an officer named Nico, reveals that there is a plot to assassinate the king, and he begs Rose to bring this information to the royal castle. Despite her apprehension, Rose does so and soon finds herself immersed in the world of royalty and nobility, many of whom also possess magical gifts of their own. As Rose grudgingly learns to trust the new friends she has made--especially the handsome, kindly young King Micah--she realizes she must stop running from her past. While she learns to master her powers and open her heart, it becomes clear that more is at stake than she ever thought possible: the fate of the kingdom may lie in her hands. Johanson deftly builds Rose's world, with the rules of the universe feeling mostly clear and easy to follow. Rose is an engaging heroine, as are many of the supporting characters. From the brusque but caring healer Master Rita to the telepathic Capt. Sayla, they generally feel complex and three-dimensional. However, as the novel builds toward its climax, the rules of the magic get a little hard to follow, making the final battle more muddled than suspenseful. There are also a few too many incidents of Rose collapsing into the king's arms from overuse of her magic or because of some other external danger (Rose even remarks, ""You are always carrying me. Why is that?"" so maybe the narrative is in on the joke). Ultimately, though, the novel is a fun, well-crafted story that fantasy readers should enjoy. The conclusion is open-ended enough to suggest at least one sequel; let's hope Johanson delivers.<br />An engaging, compulsively readable fantasy.""<br />-Kirkus<br /><br /><span>Shadow's Voice by Natalie Johanson is a beautiful read for fantasy lovers. Roselyn Ula has had a very rough past and she thinks running away from it is the only form of redemption left for her. But one never runs away from one's self. Destiny puts her on the path of a messenger who beckons her to complete his mission for the King. Now, she must travel to the castle to save the king from an enemy who will stop at nothing to see him overthrown. Is Rose ready to open her soul, connect with her shadow magic, and face the challenges that await her? Shadow's Voice is a tale of magic, but most importantly, it's a story of redemption won through heroism and unrelenting courage.</span><br /><br /><span>Natalie Johanson has an arresting writing gift and her prose will surely seduce lovers of beautiful words. I loved the descriptive style and the images the writing conjures up, making readers see things very clearly. The narrative voice comes across with strength and unwavering conviction. The plot is well imagined and executed with a lot of style; it moves very fast, with enough to make the reader curious about what happens next. I loved the characters. Yes, they are compelling and fully fledged. Rose is one that readers will root for. She comes flawed with her past and torn between seeking redemption and offering her services for the welfare of her people. The conflict that rages within her is the catalyst that propels the story forward. Shadow's Voice is an impassioned page-turner that fantasy fans can't put down. Its satisfactory ending could be the promise of another beautiful story in the making.</span>,,,"

The main interest here is devoted to the kri tin and karaka sections with the corresponding prakriya to the syntactic construction of words in a spoken utterance Sanskrit being an inflected language and to phonetic changes due to a given sequence of phonemes. Our aim is to provide a detailed insight in Paninian derivational morphology applied in the taddhita section of the Astadhyayi. Small formal elements are introduced and maybe deleted again which serve as the cause of a change in the lexical meaning of the original nominal stem. For this purpose we have made extensive use of the Paninlyavyakaranodaharanakosa La grammaire paninienne par ses examples. Vol. I Udaharanasamhahara by F. Grimal V. Venkataraja Sarma V Shrivatsakacharya S. Laksminarasimhan. Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha. Tirupati 2004-2007 Ecole Francaise d Extreme Orient. Institute Francais de Tirupati.<br /><br />We have identified the taddhita suffix concerned for each entry in alphabetical order together with the mention of the rule concerned and of the passage traditional grammatical texts the Mahabhasya the KV and the Siddhantaumudi. As will be seen from our work the taddhita section shows a minuted detail of etymological study and an amazing detail of categorization and sub categorization in order to present an intelligible lexicological account of the variety of language use. The question which arises here and to which we have no answer is how could one man retain all that detail in his memory? Consequently the other question regarding the authorship of the Astadhyayi whether the taddhita section comes from a different author or from different authors remains unresolved.<br /><br />we have also supplie

Toss together a mixed salad of guests old and young, eccentric and stuffy, pleasant and revolting, add a peppering of assorted employees, and you have the makings for first rate entertainment, a real microcosm of human nature a la carte. Mrs. Erskine and the celebrated author of Auntie Mame have taken full advantage of the opportunities offered by the Pink Hotel. Under the tropic skies there is plenty of drama, a modicum of romance and laughter, and some unforgettably queer fish to observe. There are sympathetic folk like Miss Dukemer, the worldly-wise cashier; and Purcell, the Assistant Director who finally chooses married life, in spite of his liking for ladies and liquor. There are pathetic ones like the rich Mellott sisters who share a suite with their adored Siamese cat; and the wealthy couple who never order more than one meagre breakfast. There are the strange ones like the Typhoid Mary pastry cook who loves her work, the new elevator boy who has a hair fetish, the fiendish Mr. Wenton - and many more whose lives are dominated by the Pink Hotel. The humorous and satirical qualities that have made the earlier books of the two authors so successful are here applied in full measure to a most varied cast of characters and their stories. Witty, compassionate, macabre, The Pink Hotel is as unique as it is fascinating."",,"

First composed by Maharishi Vyasa in verse, it has come down the centuries in the timeless oral tradition of guru and sishya, profoundly influencing the history, culture and art of not only the Indian subcontinent but most of south-east Asia. At 100,000 couplets it is seven times as long as the lliad and the Odyssey combined: far and away the greatest recorded epic known to man. The Mahabharata is the very Book of Life: in its variety, majesty and also its violence and tragedy. It has been said that nothing exists that cannot be found within the pages of this awesome legend. The epic describes a great war of some 5000 years ago and the events that led to it. The war Kurushetra sees ten million Kshatriyas slain and brings the Dwapara Yuga to an end and ushers in a new and sinister age: this present kali Yuga, modern times. At the heart of the Mahabharata nestles the Bhagavad Gita, the Songs of God. Senayor Ubhayor madhye, between two teeming armies, Krishna expounds the eternal dharma to his warrior of light, Arjuna. At one level all the restless action of the Mahabharata is a quest for the Gita and its scared stillness. After the carnage, it is the Gita that survives, immortal lotus floating upon the dark waters of desolation: the final secret! With its magnificent cast of characters, human, demonic and divine and its riveting narrative, the Mahabharata continues to enchant readers and scholar the world over. This new rendering brings the epic to the contemporary reader in sparki8ng modern prose. It brings alive all the excitement, magic and grandeur of the original for our times. --Unknown,Ramesh Menon was born in 1951 in New Delhi. He has lived and worked n Delhi, Hong Kong, Bangalore and Jakarta, and presently lives in Kodaikanal. The other Book published by him is a modern translation of the Ramayana."

Abby, therapist, wife, and mother, is unable to move beyond the loss she feels two years after the death of her young daughter. Miranda, 12, closeted away by her father to protect her from the world, has not been outside their apartment since her mother left years ago because when she's out in the world, she is nearly catatonic. Once she becomes Abby's patient, they somehow manage to heal each other, which does not please Miranda's father. Marek skillfully explores the balance between therapist and patient, parent and child, and husband and wife through strong imagery and striking characters in difficult situations. Readers will recognize the experience of struggling through the surf to reach the calm water beyond the waves and see it as an apt metaphor for the experiences Marek so sensitively dramatizes. <i>Danise Hoover</i><br><i>Copyright &#169; American Library Association.

Devil May Care is a James Bond continuation novel written by Sebastian Faulks. It was published in the UK by Penguin Books on 28 May 2008, the 100th anniversary of the birth of Ian Fleming, the creator of Bond. The story centres on Bond's investigation into Dr Julius Gorner, a megalomaniac chemist with a deep-seated hatred of England.

Faulks wrote the book in the style of Fleming, and the novel carried the credit ""Sebastian Faulks writing as Ian Fleming""; he also took the same timeframe as Fleming, setting the novel in 1967, following the events in Fleming's last novel The Man with the Golden Gun. He ignored the influences of the other Bond continuation authors and the films, producing a characterisation of Bond in the style of Fleming's.

The novel was broadly well received by critics and went into the best-seller lists by the end of the first week of sales, selling 44,093 copies in four days to become the fastest-selling fiction book after the Harry Potter titles. Faulks stated that although he enjoyed writing the book, he would write no more Bond novels."

The fourth volume contained the authors collected writings, and for the present English publication this material has been divided among three books, of which this is the Third. These books also include all Botvinniks known games (apart from the 381 already published in the Botvinniks Best Games series), with annotations by Botvinnik where available. The resulting six-volume series therefore present a complete collection of Botvinniks own game annotations and the best of his chess writings.

God is looking for bold Christians with the courage to be different and serve Him with a radical faith. Joyce explains that when you step out in faith, God provides the anointing and direction for you to accomplish what you could never do on your own.

This two-part audio teaching will challenge you to take risks to achieve the dreams, visions and goals that God has ordained for you.

Figure maybe three years before those words are spoken, for Crichton's new novelAdespite media reports about trouble in selling film rights, which finally went to ParamountAis as cinematic as they come, a shiny science-fantasy adventure powered by a superior high concept: a group of young scientists travel back from our time to medieval southern France to rescue their mentor, who's trapped there. The novel, in fact, may improve as a movie; its complex action, as the scientists are swept into the intrigue of the Hundred Years War, can be confusing on the page (though a supplied map, one of several graphics, helps), and most of its characters wear hats (or armor) of pure white or black. Crichton remains a master of narrative drive and cleverness. From the startling opening, where an old man with garbled speech and body parts materializes in the Arizona desert, through the revelation that a venal industrialist has developed a risky method of time-travel (based on movement between parallel universes; as in Crichton's other work, good, hard science abounds), there's not a dull moment. When elderly Yale history prof Edward Johnston travels back to his beloved 15th century and gets stuck, and his assistants follow to the rescue, excitement runs high, and higher still as Crichton invests his story with terrific period detail and as castles, sword-play, jousts, sudden death and enough bold knights-in-armor and seductive ladies-in-waiting to fill any toystore's action-figure shelves appear. There's strong suspense, too, as Crichton cuts between past and present, where the time-travel machinery has broken: Will the heroes survive and make it back? The novel has a calculated feel but, even so, it engages as no Crichton tale has done since Jurassic Park, as it brings the past back to vigorous, entertaining life."

Roosevelt's glamorous twenty-one year old daughter Alice served as mistress of the cruise, which included senators and congressmen. On this trip, Taft concluded secret agreements in Roosevelt's name.

In 2005, a century later, James Bradley traveled in the wake of Roosevelt's mission and discovered what had transpired in Honolulu, Tokyo, Manila, Beijing and Seoul.

In 1905, Roosevelt was bully-confident and made secret agreements that he though would secure America's westward push into the Pacific. Instead, he lit the long fuse on the Asian firecrackers that would singe America's hands for a century.
Bradleys first books, Flags of Our Fathers (2000) and Flyboys (2003), were sensationally popular World War II combat stories. His new one, about U.S.-Japanese diplomacy in 1905, represents a departure. Asserting a causal connection between diplomatic understandings reached then and war 36 years later, Bradley dramatizes his case with a delegation Theodore Roosevelt dispatched to Japan in the summer of 1905. Led by Secretary of War William Taft and ornamented by the presidents quotable daughter Alice, it sailed while TR hosted the peace conference between victorious Japan and defeated Russia. As he recounts the itinerary of Tafts cruise, Bradley discusses attitudes of social Darwinism and white superiority that were then prevalent and expressed by TR and Taft. They modified their instincts, Bradley argues, in dealing with nonwhite Japan, and secretly conceded it possession of Korea. This is what Bradley asserts was a prerequisite to Pearl Harbor in 1941, a dubious thesis when the tensions of the 1930s stemmed from general Japanese aggressiveness, not its control of Korea per se.

Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel,<i>Cup of Gold</i>(1929). After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books,<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i>(1932) and<i>To a God Unknown</i>(1933), and worked on short stories later collected in<i>The Long Valley</i>(1938). Popular success and financial security came only with<i>Tortilla Flat</i>(1935), stories about Montereys paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class:<i>In Dubious Battle</i>(1936),<i>Of Mice and Men</i>(1937), and the book considered by many his finest,<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>(1939).<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>won both theNational Book Awardand thePulitzer Prizein 1939.Steinbeck received theNobel Prize in Literaturein 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with theUnited States Medal of Freedomby President Lyndon B. Johnson. Steinbeck died in New York in 1968. Today, more than 30 years after his death, he remains one of America's greatest writers and cultural figures.<br /><br /><b>Rosa Harvan Kline</b> was a film producer and photographer. She produced the documentary films <i>Crisis</i>(1939) and<i>The Forgotten Village </i>(1941)<i>.</i><br /><br /><b>Alexander Hackensmid </b>(19072004) was a film director and cinematographer best known for <i>Crisis </i>(1939)<i>, The Forgotten Village </i>(1941), and <i>Meshes in the Afternoon </i>(1946).

It's 1908, and Katie is devoted to her beloved New York Giants and their ace pitcher, Christy Mathewson. While she and her beau enjoy a hotly contested game, Burke adds tidbits of trivia. Readers learn about Mathewson, the Polo Grounds, pitching, umpires and hand signals, and Cracker Jack, which was introduced in 1893. Fans will enjoy these anecdotes, and many more. The lively paintings capture the infectious excitement of the big game, and Pete Hamill contributes a stirring introduction. Report writers will have to look elsewhere for the complete story, but, overall, Burke has fashioned a sparkling introduction to an exhilarating period in baseball history.<I>-Marilyn Taniguchi, Beverly Hills Public Library, CA</I> <BR>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,Gr. 2-4. The complete lyrics of the famous baseball song, some of which will be unfamiliar to young readers, provide the framework for this commentary on a legendary New York game: the historic and still controversial 1908 showdown between the New York Giants and the Chicago Cubs. Each spread prominently features a line from the song as well as boxed text featuring information about this particular game, plenty of turn-of-the-century baseball trivia, and notes about the song lyrics (the history of Cracker Jack, for instance). Facing pages showcase Burke's stately oil paintings on gessoed board, which build a narrative around the song's little-known fictional character Katie Casey, imagined here as a fan attending the game. An introduction by veteran author and New Yorker Pete Hamill establishes broader historical context, and full song lyrics with musical notation are appended (along with a reproduction of composer Jack Norworth's original manuscript). Despite generous visuals, the history here is dense and eclectically presented; offer this to young readers who are just moving beyond picture books and passionate about the sport. <i>GraceAnne DeCandido</i><br><i>Copyright &#169; American Library Association.

Al tratar a creyentes que sufren de depresin espiritual, Bridge manifiesta una clara percepcin de las cosas que producen desnimo en los santos, tales como grandes pecados, gracia dbil, abandono de las disciplinas espirituales, falta de seguridad, la tentacin, el abandono y la afliccin. Un diagnstico correcto representa ms de la mitad de la curacin, pero Bridge no deja a sus lec tores ah. Ofrece directrices para aplicar el remedio. Por ejemplo, al tratar sobre ""grandes pecados"", dice: ""Si de verdad quieres humillarte sin desanimarte, entonces busca la fuente de todos tus pecados en la incredulidad y echa todo el peso de tu tristeza sobre este pecado"".

Also included is an especially powerful form of the Sri Suktam, known as Samputita Sri Suktam. 

In the Samputita Sri Suktam, very powerful mantras from the Chandi Saptasati are incorporated into the Sri Suktam, which magnifies its auspicious energy. In addition, a wonderful Lakshmi mantra is also added, which contains the auspicious seed syllables ""Srim"" and ""Hrim."" These seed syllables, or bijaksharas, are extremely powerful and shower the subtle nervous system with divine nectar.

Amma recommends the chanting of Sri Suktam or Samputita Sri Suktam every day. According to the Vedas, we can overcome all karmic difficulties if we chant the Sri Suktam in front of a Sri Chakra every day. When the Samputita Sri Suktam is chanted in front of a Sri Chakra, the sacred vibrations of the sounds are attracted to the central point, or bindu, of the Sri Chakra. As the sound vibrations focus and become absorbed in the bindu, a tremendous cosmic energy emanates from the Sri Chakra and blesses the chanter as well as the entire household. It has been said that chanting the Samputita Sri Suktam in front of a Sri Chakra is equal to chanting all four Vedas ten million times. 

From the Introduction:

""The Sri Suktam is a beautiful Vedic hymn in honor of the Divine Mother Sri Maha Lakshmi Devi. Sri Karunamayi Amma has explained that the Sri Suktam is the essence of the Vedas, and that it contains all the important information about Divne Mother. The essential message of the Sri Suktam is that Mother's true form is the beautiful, cosmic golden light of divine consciousness that shines in the hearts of all creatures."""

His success came in England, where he was based from 1953 to 1984, and then from 1994 until his death. In 1957 Carrier wrote his first article on food, which he sold to Harper's Bazaar editor Eileen Dickson. He was soon writing regularly for the magazine before becoming a contributor to Vogue and then writing a weekly column for the colour supplement of the Sunday Times. This column brought him celebrity; the articles were collected and expanded to create his first cookery book, the lavishly illustrated Great Dishes of the World, in 1963. Despite its high price, it sold 11 million copies. Assured of publicity, Carrier opened the eponymous restaurant Carrier's in 1959 in Camden Passage, Islington, then developed an international chain of cookshops, with the first in Harrods in 1967. His recipes were printed on wipe-clean cards (a convenient innovation), and were more specific in their quantities and directions than some of those of his competitor Elizabeth David; they made it feasible for an amateur to prepare food that would satisfy the eye and palate of even demanding dinner guests. In the late 1970s, Carrier began presenting a television series, Carrier's Kitchen, based on the cooking cards from his Sunday Times articles. After the more traditional British fare, Carrier in colour television format introduced British TV viewers to a more exotic range of Continental cooking. With a highly theatrical and camp style, and a penchant for superlatives (""Gooorgeous Adooorable Faaabulous!""), he attracted viewers as much for his drawling American vowels and shameless self-promotion. His later followed this with three other series, titled Food, Wine and Friends, The Gourmet Vegetarian and Carrier's Caribbean. From this greater publicity flowed a substantial magazine published weekly by Marshall Cavendish between 1981 and 1983.,,"

In this series, we see that the Bible teaches that healthy marriages and families are based on the nature and character of God. The Bible charges man with exercising a loving and sacrificial leadership of his wife. Tom sets forth these principles of biblical headship and explains what they look like in everyday terms. He then describes the qualities of The Fairer Sex and how a woman can find fulfillment and divine approval in her respectful submission to her husband and service to her family. We also see that God has spoken with almost embarrassing clarity on the subject of the sexual relationship in marriage. In Sanctified Sexuality, Tom presents practical counsel to married couples on how to have a fulfilling sexual relationship in marriage. And for Singles, in The Art of Singlehood, we see that the plans for a healthy marriage and future family are laid down while we are single. We also find helpful guidance on those particularly difficult areas of conflict resolution (The Rules of Engagement), how to have healthy relationships with in-Laws (The Ins and Outs of In-Laws) and money management (Mates and Money). This series will prove to be a great resource for personal or group study on marriage and the family. This series includes:

Marriage 2-Man, the Lover :: I Pet 3:7, Eph 5:22

There are endless possibilities, many different techniques. For example, you may choose to be very exact with your painting. There is another side of watercolor, however, where just about anything goes. Where colors merge wonderfully with other colors. Where a subject is suggested ever so slightly in the painting, tempting our minds to guess at its mysterious contents. In watercolor, either type of painting is correct and accepted. So, if there were one gift I could give you if you're a beginner, it would be the ability to relax and have fun while you paint. To not be too hard on yourself, and give yourself time to learn and grow. Challenge yourself to look at your paintings a bit differently . . . to let the edge soften where it wasn't planned, to allow the colors to mingle a bit even though it's a surprise, and to know that just because it turned out ""different"", it's definitely not wrong!!"

<br /> A Kingdom Woman begins by embracing a simple premise: Unless a Kingdom rests firmly under in the authority of the ruler, anarchy reigns. That&apos;s why a Kingdom Woman always seeks to align herself and operate under the authority of God-in every area of life. With practical insights and applications from co-author Chrystal Evans Hurst, Tony Evans explains how that process can unleash new purpose, power, and possibilities-in both the lives of Kingdom Women and those they love. Women will be encouraged to embrace their role as leaders under God&apos;s authority, and challenged to live as true heirs under the covenant God has made with his children. They&apos;ll also be affirmed in their identity as valued daughters of Christ."

Called to investigate the disappearance of beautiful teenager Ruth Stoner, Duluth, Minn., police detective Lt. Jonathan Stride is haunted by the disappearance of another teen, Kerry McGrath, 14 months earlier. Stride's an honest, likable cop, full of angst over the cancer death of his beloved wife. He has a great working relationship with diminutive partner Maggie Bei, who's been in love with him for years. As Stride and Mags investigate, the only aspect of the case that becomes clear is that everyone involved with the crime&mdash;the victim, her family and her friends&mdash;is guilty of something. Tweezing apart these strands of guilt and trying to connect them to the missing Ruth occupies Stride for more than three years. Finally, in an extended denouement, the pieces fall into place, and Stride is able to solve not only the mysteries of both Ruth and Kelly, but mend his own fractured life as well. <I>BOMC and Literary Guild main selections; Doubleday Book Club and Mystery Guild alternates.

No doubt, his prose can be worthy cause for wincing ( ""Tight black jeans, the kind you need a knife to cut yourself out of""), but Freeman paints the requisite cold, gray atmospheric tones for a tale of murder, sex, and intrigue.

He was both a dedicated opponent of slavery in all its form, even going so far as to advocate guerrilla war to stop it, but also a dedicated opponent of the federal invasion of the South and its postwar reconstruction. 
 This collection was selected personally by Murray Rothbard as his best work. It includes ""Trial by Jury,"" which argues for the idea of jury nullification, that is, the right of the jury to reject the law under which a defendant is tried. It also includes his ""Letter to Grover Cleveland,"" which remains one of the most rigorous pieces of political argument ever penned. Finally, it includes his classic work ""No Treason,"" which argues that the U.S. Constitution is not a social contract at all and that it cannot bind the current generation. 
 Spooner was obviously a great dissident -- and one of the most brilliant thinkers of the 19th century and an American original. His influence has been quiet but very long and pervasive. 
 The title here is of Rothbard's own choosing, but it sums up the theme of his best work.

Comics like Tales of The Mysterious Traveler and This Magazine Is Haunted saw an explosion in Ditkos ingenuity, as he manipulated the traditional comic-book page layout with masterful results. It was during this time that Ditko and his art-school colleague, the famed fetish artist Eric Stanton, began sharing a studio in Manhattan. The introduction by editor Blake Bell examines Ditkos stylistic evolution and delves deep into his association with Stanton. Ditkos secret collaborations with Stanton on his female bondage material remain a highly controversial topic, and Bells introduction highlights numerous examples that prove the allegedly shy and private Ditko contributed with wild abandon to these risqu tales of titillation. This fifth volume stands as the best example yet of the Steve Ditko that would soon begin crafting such iconic classics as Spider-Man and Doctor Strange alongside Stan Lee at Marvel Comics."

In some ways more exciting reading, with its spirit of adventure; more challenging, with its realism and fearlessness (it is easy to see why he proved persona non grata to British brass hats); and -- on the whole -- better written. His was a perpetual Jeremiah role; he sought out the facts and battled for the truth -- in time. This is his story in detail -- again proving the old adage, that truth is stranger than fiction. From the struggle of the British in the Near East early in 1941, through the doom of the British in the Pacific:- he saw brave men at their best, and tells their stories superbly; he was on the Repulse when she sank; he told Lieutenant Chapple's undersea thriller to the world; his story of Captain Wheless' great air battle is a hair raiser. He does not hesitate to name names and air facts; he wants to show the reasons behind the events. Essentially a hard- boiled realist, he reveals a softer, human, almost sentimental side. Grand reading -- and with the promised big all-out backing of promotion and advertising, it should go places. Pub Date: Oct. 22nd, 1942,,"

[],Dream World,[],Kent Winslow,"15,667,995 in Books (",[],Books,42.96,B000KSBR86,"{'Publisher:': 'The Match!; First Thus edition (1990)', 'ASIN:': 'B000KSBR86'}","This novel is the tale of a lifetime of abuse that begins and ends with terrorization by the police.

As a child, Kent, the narrator, is dragged around the country by his father, a screaming psychotic who is also an itinerant radio announcer. Kent doesn't stay in one place, or school, for very long, because his father keeps getting fired. After several years of this, the father decides to stay in a town called Mormonville and start his own station. Kent gets to see organized religion, expecially Mormonism, first hand while he is forced to work at the station, every day, until he is able to escape into a local college. He does not like what he sees.

College is a place where the teachers are snitches for the military (this is during the Vietnam War). At least in math and science class, there are provable right and wrong answers (2+2=4, and nothing else). On the other hand, in classes like English and Psychology, it seems like the right answer is whatever the teacher says it is. The school is full of people who are taught, or indoctrinated, to believe whatever authority figures tell them to believe. Therefore, if war protesters are anti-American commie agitators, then, by god, that is what they are. He barely survives ROTC (a required course where nothing is more important than keeping the uniform free of even microscopic traces of dirt and making sure that all parts of the uniform are in mathematically precise alignment with all other parts). Kent also has run-ins with people who take their small bit of authority much too seriously.Kent and several friends are arrested on trumped-up charges, and reluctantly let go several months later when the judicial farce (aided by the local newspaper) temporarily goes off the track. He is married for a while, until his wife announces that she is gay. Kent barely survives by publishing an anarchist zine, until the government bars its circulation, while most of his friends have joined The State."

The omens and oracles, fantastic tales and fables, told to him on his travels through Greece, Africa and the Near East, and faithfully recorded, once earned him the soubriquet the Father of Lies. Stories of Hippias, the exiled Athenian tyrant and turncoat, who coughed up a tooth on the sands at Marathon and saw his hopes of reclaiming power vanish with it; of the mysterious tribe of Gyzantes, who painted themselves red and dined on monkeys; of the one-eyed Arimaspians who waged an endless struggle against the gold-guarding griffins of the frozen north. Only recently, as history has absorbed the lessons of anthropologists and ethnographers, archaeologists and folklorists, has the truth hidden at the heart of Herodotus fanciful tales come to life. More than ever, his stature as a historian is unequalled.

It is Herodotus narrative of the iconic episodes of the Persian Wars that have most inspired imaginations through the ages and retain their power to thrill to this day: the enraged King Xerxes ordering the seas to be flogged for daring to defy his orders; a mighty Persian army so vast it drank whole rivers dry; Athenian hoplites stampeding across the plain of Marathon; the last stand of the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae. The result is the first great work of prose in European literature  and one of the most inexhaustibly entertaining books ever written."

He renders scenes of great emotion with equal parts passion and precision. At it's core, <i>The Exiles </i>is a classic tale of tragic, forbidden love, but Dhalla infuses it with an astute discussion of Hindu culture that should appeal to a broad cross-section of readers.<br>- Christopher Rice, New York Times best-selling author of <i>A Density of Souls </i><br><br><i>""The Exiles</i> is a powerful, sure footed novel of love, longing and loss that richly portrays life like no other work of fiction I've read.

The novel provides a refreshing view of life and love in Los Angeles, particularly in the South Asian immigrant community...<i>The Exiles</i> isn't strictly an immigrant narrative, a coming out narrative, or a religious narrative but rather lies somewhere between them all...The book draws a distinct line between love and passion and the way in which those feelings move us to action...A poignant mediation on love and relationship. The novel prompts reflection on how we form our identities and ultimately questions our duties to our families and ourselves.&quot; <br>- Los Angeles Magazine.<br><br>&quot;Stands to be added to such to be added to novels such as <i>The Namesake </i>and <i>Snow Flower and the Secret Fan</i> as a story that blends relatable human drama with the tapestry of different cultures.&quot;<br>- Frontiers Magazine.<br><br>&quot;Plays out like a modern Shakespearean tragedy. <i>The Exiles</i> is a multilayered, richly written story exploring a sexless marriage, a family drifting apart, the trappings of middle age, the thrill and fear of new-found same-sex love and the cultural insights of those that have immigrated to our country.&quot; <br>- Instinct Magazine.<br><br>&quot;Ghalib Shiraz houses magic in his eyes, or in his hands or in his brain...He writes with such fluid prose that each page approaches a lapse into poetry. Not only is his story one which defies the reader to pause before the complex story plays out, but it also informs us of the myriad aspects of immigration and the sense of being dispossessed. In short this is a compelling novel that not only grows into our psyche but also quietly changes the way we perceive the injustices around us. There is so much in this novel to mesmerize the reader that words in a review falter in attempting to express the impact of this fine novel. Rarely has a love story in all its facets and permutations been so consistently effective and affecting. Ghalib Shiraz Dhalla is an inordinately gifted writer - one of our best. His gift is extravagant but it is also keenly honed in subtlety. We should be hearing a lot more about him in the coming months and years.&quot;<br>- Good Reads.<br><br>&quot;As with <i>Ode to Lata,</i> his (semi) autobiographical debut novel about a young Hindu man coming to terms with being gay, out Indian author, Ghalib Shiraz Dhalla continues to write about provocative subject matters.&quot; <br>- Advocate Magazine<br><br>&quot;Worlds clash and lives are destroyed...(Dhalla) wrote this book because he wanted to expose the catastrophes people create when they lie to themselves as well as the people they love...Ghalib peppers his story with full-on drama and the book describes both the city of LA and the lives of its <i>desi </i>immigrants extremely evocatively.&quot;<br>- VERVE Magazine<br><br>&quot;Another masterfully written novel by the brilliant young writer Ghalib Shiraz Dhalla, an accomplished filmmaker and author of the critically acclaimed novel <i>Ode to Lata. </i> This fiction novel is simply wonderful.&quot;<br>- Sahara Time<br><br><i>&quot;The Exiles</i> by Ghalib Shiraz Dhalla is a book about love coming out of the closet, and since it is not exactly between man and wife, there is inevitable trauma in the family...Dhalla has detailed all this with fascinating humanity and compassion.&quot;<br>- Afternoon Despatch & Courier<br><br>&quot;Grappling with the infidelity of your spouse is painfoul enough. Making it harder for Pooja Kapoor, a successful caterer, is the fact that Rahul, a high-flying banker, has given his heart to a young Muslim man, Atif. This forces the entire family, including their son Ajay, to recalibrate their definitions of right, wrong, morality, acceptability, sin and redemption. An intriguing premise by author-columnist-filmmaker Ghalib Shiraz Dhalla made even more magnetic by his lyrical prose inspired by Sufi poetry, Hindu culture and mythology. Indeed, <i>The Exiles</i> is the kind of book you engage with on so many levels - the plot itself, with its arresting characters; the deeper questions it throws up about our fragile truths, sexual politics and gender orientation; and most of all, the remarkable telling of it all. Sensitive, searing, sensual and always compassionate, Dhalla transports us to the crossroads of faith and fealty, duty and desire - and then shows us the way home, to the heart.&quot; <br>- Harmony India"

Penthouse has been owned by Penthouse Global Media Inc. since 2016. Although Guccione was American, the magazine was founded in 1965, in the United Kingdom, but beginning in September 1969, was sold in the United States as well. At the height of his success, Guccione, who died in 2010, was considered to be one of the richest men in the United States. He was once listed in the Forbes 400 ranking of wealthiest people (1982]). An April 2002 New York Times article reported Guccione as saying that Penthouse grossed $3.5 billion to $4 billion over the 30-year life of the company, with net income of almost half a billion dollars. The Penthouse logo is a stylized key which incorporates both the Mars and Venus symbols in its design. The magazine's centerfold models are known as Penthouse Pets and customarily wear a distinctive necklace inspired by said logo. Pornographic magazines, or erotic magazines, sometimes known as adult, sex or top-shelf magazines, are magazines that contain content of an explicitly sexual nature. Publications of this kind may contain images of attractive naked subjects, as is the case in softcore pornography, and, in the usual case of hardcore pornography, depictions of masturbation, oral or anal sex, or intercourse. They primarily serve to stimulate sexual arousal, and are often used as an aid to masturbation."

IM van de Oudeweetering has done a good job identifying and classifying instructive middlegame positions by theme. Club players rated between 1600-2200 will benefit from this book and master level players (2200 and up) are also likely to pick up some new ideas by carefully reviewing the material. (James Rizzitano <i>ChessCafe.com</i>)<br /><br />Very practical and perfect for self-study. The book is written in an entertaining way, working with it is a joy (...) Suitable for beginners as well. (Uwe Bekemann <i>German Correspondence Chess Federation</i>)<br /><br />I think it's an excellent book, and while it's not systematic in a way that would turn it into a primer on positional play, there is no question but that this will improve the positional understanding of many club players. I'd highly recommend this to players rated around 1400 to 2100, and I think even master can (and will) learn something from this book as well. (Dennis Monokroussos <i>The Chess Mind</i>)<br /><br />Once the reader has started applying these patterns in their own games, they will find that the post-opening phase of the game becomes easier and they will more often build up a strong position. (Grandmaster Ian Rogers, Four-time Champion of Australia)<br /><br />Every improving player will learn a lot from this book. (IM Gary Lane <i>Chess Moves Magazine</i>)<br /><br />It is an excellent book when it comes to freshen up the arsenal of typical but also unusual positional themes. This book calls for collecting positional ideas just as you collect typical combinations. Normally in a game the positional ideas precede the combinations and that's why this middlegame book is so important. (International Master Thomas Engqvist <i>SchackSnack</i>)<br /><br />The experienced Dutch IM, analyst and coach helps us to realize which positions are worth remembering. Nowadays the term 'building blocks' should be familiar to most readers and they form the core of Van de Oudeweetering's book. (<i>CHESS Magazine</i>)<br /><br />Perfect for chess trainers who wish to teach their pupils themes in a way that is easy to remember.

To the present day the name of Rembrandt remains synonymous with ""great painter."" During most of his lifetime, Rembrandt's portraits were in great demand by the wealthy middle class of Amsterdam, and his self portraits are considered among the most perceptive in the history of art. Many of Rembrandt's most famous paintings, such as The Anatomy Lessons of Dr. Tulp and The Night Watch -both reproduced in full color in this book, are in fact, group portraits. Also in this book are superb reproductions of Rembrandt's equally renowned religious paintings, including The Descent from the Cross, The Angel Preventing Abraham from Sacrificing His Son Isaac, and Susannah Surprised by the Elders - as well as such works based on mythological and allegorical subjects as Saskia as Flora (a portrait of his wife) and Danae. Rembrandt's etchings, too, are unsurpassed; an example is The Flight into Egypt, which is included here. The artist was able to impart to this black and white medium the same spontaneity, realism, penetrating characterization, and dramatic effects of light and shadow, that characterize his masterful paintings"

Thebook is divided into six parts, each covering topics in biblical culture, including family structure, the place of women, sexual violence, inheritance, and the historicity of the Bible. The author explains in the introduction that the intention of the book is to describe biblical stories within their cultural and historical context. Within the six parts are twenty-six chapters, each devoted to explaining details related to the topic in each part, with emphasis on the patriarchs and their experiences of family,marriage, conflict and tradition. The book concludes with a selected bibliography that covers a wide range of sources. What is unique about the book is its scholarly explanation of biblical concepts in laymans terms making the text of the book appropriate for any adult or young adult reader. This book is appropriate for any librarys non-fiction collection. --Arthur G.

The imminent arrival of barbarian enemies at their gates is only the least of her problems, as recalcitrant allies, mutinous captains, angry ghosts and spirits, lurking assassins, and jealous lovers begin to spring their traps and plots. Then in issue #2, Artesia must deal with the Traitor King as Abenton falls under siege by King Euwen."

FOREWORD: This book has been written with the intention of serving: 1. The beginner who needs a text which will provide a thorough understanding of the theory which underlies the harmony of modern (North) American arranging, jazz, and all areas of composition which use scales and chords as a starting point. The text assumes only that the beginner has a basic ability to read music, a knowledge of the treble and bass staffs, a little playing and listening experience, and an interest. 2. The novice arranger, who is often hampered by the lack of a proper foundation in harmonic technique and part movement. 3. The professional arranger or composer, who may find that this codification of harmonic principles will provide him with a deeper understanding, and perhaps some fresh avenues of musical thought.

Sure, it's filled with Bryson's recollections of his Des Moines, Iowa, childhood. But it's also a clear foray into Jean Shepherd territory, where nostalgia for one's youth is suffused with comic hyperbole: ""All sneakers in the 1950s had over seven dozen lace holes,"" we're told; though all the toys were crummy, it didn't matter because boys had plenty of fun throwing lit matches at each other; and mimeograph paper smelled wonderful. The titular Thunderbolt Kid is little more than a recurring gag, a self-image Bryson invokes to lash out at the ""morons"" that plague every child's existence. At other times, he offers a glib pop history of the decade, which works fine when discussing teen culture or the Cold War but falls flat when trying to rope in the Civil Rights movement. And sometimes he just wants to reminisce about his favorite TV shows or the Dick and Jane books. The book is held together by sheer force of personality&mdash;but when you've got a personality as big as Bryson's, sometimes that's enough. <I>(Oct. 17)</I> <BR>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,Adult/High School&ndash;The Thunderbolt Kid was born in the 1950s when six-year-old Bryson found a mysterious, scratchy green sweater with a satiny thunderbolt across the chest. The jersey bestowed magic powers on the wearer&ndash;X-ray vision and the power to zap teachers and babysitters and deflect unwanted kisses from old people. These are the memoirs of that Kid, whose earthly parents were not really half bad&ndash;a loving mother who didn't cook and was pathologically forgetful, but shared her love of movies with her youngest child, and a dad who was the greatest baseball writer that ever lived and took his son to dugouts and into clubhouses where he met such famous players as Stan Musial and Willie Mays. Simpler times are conveyed with exaggerated humor; the author recalls the middle of the last century in the middle of the country (Des Moines, IA), when cigarettes were good for you, waxy candies were considered delicious, and kids were taught to read with Dick and Jane. Students of the decade's popular culture will marvel at the insular innocence described, even as the world moved toward nuclear weapons and civil unrest. Bryson describes country fairs and fantastic ploys to maneuver into the tent to see the lady stripper, playing hookey, paper routes, church suppers, and more. His reminiscences will entertain a wide audience.<I>&ndash;Jackie Gropman, Chantilly Regional Library, Fairfax County, VA</I> <BR>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Observing the west's development and use of the helicopter, the Mil OKB was tasked with developing such a capability for the Soviet Union as well. With the widespread success of the Mi-4 (NATO Codenamed 'Hound') as a utility and combat support aircraft within the Soviet and Warsaw Pact armed forces, designers started to look at the requirements for a more capable machine in the late 1950s. First flown in 1961, the V-8 prototype would be the beginning of the development of one of the world's most versatile helicopters, the Mi-8 (NATO Codenamed 'Hip'). Powered by a pair of TV-2-117 turbine engines, the Mi-8 would become the Soviet analog to the US's UH-1 Iroquois (Huey). The aircraft could be adapted to a wide range of missions, but unlike the UH-1, the Mi-8 had greater range, cargo capacity, and twin-engined reliability. Like the UH-1, key components of the Mi-8 would be adapted into an attack helicopter variant, the Mi-24 (NATO-Codenamed 'Hind') - the UH-1 components of course were used in the development of the AH-1 Cobra. The authors have collected a significant number of nice color photographs of the Mi-8 and these photos look into the various nooks and crannies of the helicopter in that style that Wings and Wheels Press is famous for. Detailed examinations of the airframe, engine, cockpit, cargo compartment, tail boom rotor and transmission and tail rotor are examined. The sub-variants covered in this title include: Mi-8/Mi-8T Mi-8TBK Mi-8/9 Interior/Exterior/Engines/etc. Mi-8PPK Mi-8S Mi-9"

Between the explicative title and the grim artwork of the English-language editionan unfocused couple in a street of shadows and heavily shuttered doorsthe tone of the well-known Turkish authors slim novel is unmistakable: Love hurts. A lot.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span>But if the conceit is one we know all too well, the way Ersoz writes his tale is fresh and intensenot to mention enlightening.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span>As the title promises, Confessions examines the entrails of a love affair now dead. In alternating chapters, a young woman and her former lover detail their ongoing agony, their crimes against self and other, and their reasons for doing as they did. The narrative slips back and forth in time as if stories are shared as they come to mind. The result is a compelling work of he-said-she-said that begs the reader to turn the pages and follow the downward spiral. It is eloquent, devastating, and as fascinating as a train wreck.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span>Her love no longer sufficed for me; the voids that grew out of the routines of our relationship increased my longing for the love of others, says the male protagonist of his female counterpart, explaining his infidelity.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span>Meanwhile, I was totally alone, she says of her life in Istanbul. The sound of rain now reminds me that the door has closed on my dream of finding love. Rain signifies the end, the end of love, the end of my life. Its raining again. Its night time again. Its Istanbul again.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span>With rampant infidelity and a spate of psychological sexual games, the novel offers a peek into a sophisticated, if tarnished, outlook on human romantic relationships. For the mature reader, Ersozs novel is a glimpse into a dark mirror. When the lovers remember their insecurities and unhealed wounds, the reader is gifted with jarring insight into the way people shape their identities and interface with others. You are so afraid of loneliness that you approach the most insincere people in the world, call them brother and hug them, so that they will love that loneliness that has become you, admits the male lover of his own downward trajectory in love.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span>Confessions, released in the spring of 2012 by Citlembik / Nettleberry, is a best-selling title in Turkey. Ersoz is prolific writer in that nation, having released several works in his native language. To date, Confessions is his only title in English.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span>--</span><span style=""font-weight:bold;"">Leia Menlove</span><span>, Foreword Reviews; September 24, 2012</span></span></span>,<span><span><span>Born in Istanbul, Turkey in 1959, </span><span style=""font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;"">Cezmi Ersoz</span><span> ranks as one of Turkey's most prolific writers of fiction and poetry.

Thrown out of the train to Pretoria, he was to taste the racial discrimination that plagued the land at that time. Subsequent experiences in South Africa sensitized him to the plight of the girmitiyas (bonded labours). Suspended between despair and a hope for an implausible escape to their promised land, the girmitiyas found in this young attorney a voice that would guide them to a new dawn.<br /><br />In The Girmitiya Saga, Giriraj Kishore retraces the socio-political background of the 19th and 20th- century South Africa, highlighting the importance of the young attorney&#39;s actions in South Africa and their monumental significance for humanity as a whole.<br /><br />After having carefully researched the subject in South Africa, England, Mauritius and India, Giriraj Kishore has imaginatively cast the facts in the mould of an arresting novel-Pebla Girmitiya.<br /><br />First published in Hindi in 1999, the novel was very well received in the world of Hindi literature. The following year, the author was honoured with the Vyas Samman by the K.K.

Each copy of the 2nd Edition is individually hand numbered and should be given in the Seller comments for each copy posted for sale. If it lacks a number between 1 and 1,000, it is not from the extremely scarce Second edition printing. These are quite rare in this edition, but we were able to track down a description of a more recent edition, which is very similar to the second:

Japanese military rifles might be seen as the Rodney Dangerfields of Curio or Relic bolt action military rifles in that ""they don't get no respect."" There are several factors that distinguish them from their contemporaries, the Mausers, the Enfields, and the the Mosin-Nagants, to name the most prolific. They rifles have not been imported en masse into the U.S. There is no readily available supply of inexpensive surplus ammunition. Additionally, they have an unearned reputation for weak actions of poor quality. Take all this, and the general lack of knowledge about Japanese rifles, into account, and its easy to see why most collectors prefer to focus on Mauser variants, Enfields, and Mosin-Nagants.

Fred Honeycutt's book, Military Rifles of Japan is designed to help the collector recognize and appreciate these often overlooked military rifles. Military Rifles of Japan begins with an extensive overview of the Japanese arsenal system that details the various arsenals and their facilities. This is followed by other sections that enable the reader to understand various markings encountered on Japanese firearms and their meaning. This includes the Kana alphabet used as series prefixes on Arisaka rifles, Kanji numbers used to designate a model/type, and a listing of all proofmarks by arsenal and factory."

A university professor, though not a historian, Bordo daringly intrudes on the turf of such popular authors as Alison Weir, David Starkey, and Philippa Gregory, all of whom have written about Anne Boleyn. Connecting speculative passages in their works to biases in contemporary sources, Bordo depicts Annes allure to preface the main subject of this work, her image after death. Polemicists of the Reformation invented a satanic Anne for Catholics and a martyred Anne for Protestants. Novelists later created a character whom writers revive repeatedlyAnne as a disturber of conventional female roles. That the real Anne, whose involvement in religious politics probably precipitated her downfall, indubitably was. Bordo flourishes in this discussion, especially in her analyses of actresses (most recently, Natalie Dormers smoldering, brainy Anne in the 2007 television series The Tudors) who have played Anne on screen. Whether Anne is regarded as a temptress or a feminist precursor, her imaginative force in popular entertainment is one that Bordo perceptively illuminates. --Gilbert Taylor,<span></span><span>""[R]ichly engrossing....[Her] enthusiasm is infectious and her range impressive...[S]himmers all over the fictional landscape, always with an acute eye...[C]</span><span>reates in its readers the deep hunger for more of the same; it'll be a cold-hearted reader indeed who doesn't finish the book wishing Bordo would have expanded it into a big fat study of the history and fiction of <em>all</em> the wives - or better yet, of Anne's own daughter, Queen Elizabeth I. But our author is something of an intellectual dynamo, and unlike poor Anne, she's got plenty of options.""</span><br /> <span>&mdash;Steve Donoghue, Open Letters Monthly</span><br /><br />""Engrossing....Ms. Bordo offers a fascinating discussion. . . . a strangely tasty book.""<br />&mdash;The&nbsp;New York Times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"

Una prosa difana, no desprovista de irona y humor negro, de la mano de un maestro reconocido del gnero de la ficcin breve. Este notable conjunto de once relatos est cruzado por el trnsito de sus protagonistas a otros pases, unos obligados por el exilio, otros en la bsqueda de nuevos horizontes econmicos, o tras una identidad propia o un lugar en el mundo. A pesar de que las experiencias de los personajes son cotidianas, la pericia del narrador las hace trascender. En Borges se nos permite asistir con sorpresa y emocin a la historia de un crtico literario chileno, sumido en la melancola, que viaja a Pars para alejarse de su pequea e inocua existencia; en Cuando cumplas veintin aos, conocer las vicisitudes de un chilenito pber al que se le informa intempestivamente que tiene que abandonar el pas en que vive; y en Efmera, ser testigo de la atraccin sexual que ejerce una fulgurante fotgrafa madrilea. Todas historias fugaces, intensas en su accin, en las que la figura femenina ocupa un lugar central. Antonio Skrmeta (1940)es uno de los autores chilenos ms ledos en todo el mundo. Con sus novelas y volmenes de relatos se ha consagrado entre los grandes narradores hispanoamericanos de la actualidad, traducido a ms de veinticinco idiomas.

Defending the truth and the canonical order of the Church,  he addresses such issues as the meaning of kolyva, the proper time for the celebration of Memorial Services, the special prerogatives due to Sunday, the theology of the divine Eucharist and the frequency of Holy Communion. Moreover, one is brought face to face with this great and holy personality, seeing him not only as a Saint and great Father of the Church, but as a sympathetic and honorable man full of love for his fellow Christians, especially for his enemies.

~+~ 

""Every time I read the books of St. Nikodemos I am inspired by his humility, his love, his steadfastness in the faith, his faithfulness to the Canons of the Church, and his unlimited love for Christ, for His Mother the holy Virgin Mary, and for the Mother Church of Christ. St. Nikodemos, although he lived in the eighteenth century, still is contemporary, and I say this because even today there are people who do not like him and accuse him of being a westernizer and unbending. But we know that St. Nikodemos can speak to our hearts today and give us direction for a truly Christian life.""

Older, only in sequence, are the symbols of reality that preceded it. From the original symbols of communication, thought went forth to forge its own pathway in the worlds of God's creation. As humanity returns to the fulness of the stature of MAN, God's creation will master once again the Universal Language of thought transference, through the action of mind. To herald this time of unfoldment, we release these messages to shed forth understanding and Light into this area of human consciousness.The greatest need of the Bearers of Light and those who work with humanity in the coming crisis will be proficiency in the quality of cosmic communications.

The Seven Stages of Purification provide the framework for the disciple's gradual progress from the cultivation of virtue up to the attainment of the final goal. Integral to the higher stages of purification are the nine types of insight-knowledge by which the disciple penetrates to the real nature of phenomena. The present book treats the stages of purification and the insight-knowledges not only with great erudition, but with the clarifying light of actual meditative experience.

He went from aid worker to victim when he was confronted by his PTSD some years later. This realistic book shows his battle and how he got back up after he hit rock bottom. I am proud of him."" General Tom Middendorp, Netherlands Chief of Defence (ret.),Surviving PTSD &amp; Moral Injury is a nonfiction memoir written by Erik Krikke. Krikke had reluctantly come to terms with the likelihood that he would be deployed as part of NATO's Multinational Medical Unit, Role 3. Those at the hospital where he was currently assigned, who would have been called up before him, had either retired or been transferred. He was an operating room nurse who had been a member of the Netherlands Army for almost fourteen years when the call from the head of the surgery department reached him. Some colleagues congratulated him on what some said would be an adventure and a professionally rewarding experience, but Krikke would far rather have stayed home with his wife and two small sons.<br /> <br /> His three months in Kandahar were everything he feared and much more. Krikke soon realized that his group would not be given the same amount of support with acclimation and adaptation as the regular troops received. The adaptation program had for some reason been dispensed with for their team, leaving them to experience their frightening new world feeling more isolated than ever. The plywood hovel they called a hospital leaked in streams when it rained, and desert dust was an inevitable part of the very air they breathed. Worse yet was the steady inrush of horribly injured combatants, soldiers, and children. Krikke soon learned to both expect and to dread the victims' urgent entreaties to let them die rather than remove a leg. While his deployment was limited to a three-month stretch, the ramifications of that time in Kandahar and the resulting PTSD would affect him for many years to come. Krikke had grown up valuing his strength and self-sufficiency, but he nearly lost his life to PTSD, only finding it again through the help of the Veteran's Institute and the friends, family and therapists who worked so closely with him.<br /> <br /> Erik Krikke's nonfiction health memoir is an intensely powerful and honest account of one medic's struggles with a disease that still remains closeted and denied by many. As I read this book, I would occasionally remember watching the television series, MASH, which was about a medical unit during the Korean War. While the show was big on comedic touches and the antics of off-duty medics, it also showed them constantly listening for, and instantly springing up, whenever the distant noise of choppers began to filter in, and the theme song, Suicide is Painless, struck a discordant and prophetic tone. Krikke's story is harsh, gritty and real; he pulls no punches in describing the awful insanity of trying to fit oddly heavy limbs into plastic bags, and his growing discomfort at finding he cared more about saving some patients' lives and limbs than others. He's also infinitely generous in sharing the aftermath of that deployment, and the steps he's been taking to survive his PTSD and understand the moral injury which compounded it. This intense and gripping memoir focuses well-deserved and overdue attention on the medical personnel, whose own mental health issues as a result of their service, are often overlooked. Surviving PTSD &amp; Moral Injury is most highly recommended. - Jack Magnus for Readers' Favorite,,Erik Krikke (1976) is a husband, a father of two and a veteran. For over 13 years he served in the army as a medic and operating room nurse. In 'Surviving PTSD &amp; moral injury - How an Afghanistan veteran breaks the silence on mental illness' he openly describes the impact of war in a raw and gripping way.,,"

Though this writers emphasis is on yogic practices in which overt behavior plays an important part it is he who points out that the yogic processes form a continuum. He therefore did not consider Hathayoga and Rajayoga to be different compartments of yoga as they are generally believed to be and stressed their interdependence (cf hatham vina rajayogo rajayogam vina hathah/na siddhyati tato yugmam ansipatteh sumabhyaset.

Hathpradipika is one of the outstanding Hatha texts which fully describe the eight well known varieties of Pranayama Svatmaramas work has proved to be a source of inspiration for many a later writer on Hathayoga as can be seen fro treatises like Yogacintamani Hatharatnavali Hathasanketacandrika and Hathatattvakaumudi as explicitly mentioned by him in I-18 Svatmarama has successfully brought about a synthesis of both the traditions of Hathayoga viz that of the munis and that of the yogis.

The opinion that all impurities in the nadis can be removed only by the practice of Pranyama has been explicitly mentioned by Sva tmarma alone. According to him the satkriyas are not obligatory for all. They are however to be practiced by all those who have an excess of meda slesma etc.

Yoga as described by Svatmarama has only four components while according to other authorities on Yoga it is said to have six, seven, eight and even fifteen components.

In the Puranas and the smrtis two types of Pranayama have been mentioned (1)Sagarbha with mantras and (2) Agarbha without recitation of mantra svatmaram however does not enjoin that practice of Pranayama should be accompanied with recitation of a mantra."

<br><br>

 
Is there a Jewish book with a few words of wisdom for every day of the year? Something that will enrich the reader? Something uplifting if one is tired of wearily pushing through a day that is spiritual dull?
 
<br><br>

Now it is here in a new English translation - the Chassidic classic HaYom Yom. This daily companion taps into Chassidic wisdom to help tackle life's tasks in a meaningful way. The Chassidic insights of the book is a bridge that will connect the reader's daily tasks with spirituality.
 
<br><br>

Generations of Rebbeim and chassidim come alive before the reader's eyes; davenen (praying) becomes rich; study becomes a consuming endeavor; and life, a mission.
 
<br><br>

The book was compiled by the Lubavitcher Rebbe and is now being published with the Hebrew and Yiddish text set new and with vowels. But the reader will find not only a fresh new English translation of each daily teaching, but also, under a separate heading, a creative comment or story or mini-farbrengen that will help him find a point of contact between that idyllic chassidic teaching - and the gray realities of his own life in the busy here and now. Moreover, for those who would like to pursue an idea to new horizons, numerous sources and cross references are provided.
 
<br><br>

Speakers often use daily entries as a theme for their talks. And many parents who seek to give their homes a chassidisher or spiritual tone read it aloud every evening when the family is gathered together at the dinner table. And then the day is not merely a block of time: it is charged with purpose and direction.

Also discussed are applications of KAM theory (especially to celestial mechanics and statistical mechanics) and the parts of mathematics and physics in which KAM theory resides (dynamical systems, classical mechanics, and Hamiltonian perturbation theory). <P> Although a number of sources on KAM theory are now available for experts, this book attempts to fill a long-standing gap at a more descriptive level.

One day the woman gives her an unmatched and empty sock in which to store things and keep them safe. This inspires Rabieta to sort, catalog, and save her many belongings in all sorts of novel ways. Things soon get out of hand until her mother intercedes and teaches Rabieta that collecting lots of stuff isn't as important as tending to what we carry within ourselves. Despite the rather heavy-handed ending, this is a quirky yet interesting book. The narrative style is com- plemented by the skewed perspective of the collage art. The illustrator used bits of fabric, textured paper, and pastels to achieve a hodgepodge look. Frequent font changes add to the overall effect. A suitable addition for larger collections.

The book has two stories that are interwoven throughout  that of Yossarian in the last stages of his life, and that of Sammy Singer and Lew Rabinowitz, two men from Coney Island who also fought in World War II (the Sammy Singer character makes a brief appearance in Catch-22 as the tailgunner aboard Yossarian's bomber who kept waking up and fainting when he saw Yossarian trying to attend to the wounds of Snowden).

As with Catch-22, the topic of death is omnipresent, only in this case from (usually) age-related illnesses, in particular cancer (rather than dying in battle, as with its predecessor)."

Introduction: ""In May of 2012, after teaching in Orvieto in Umbria, I met my parents in Rome and we flew to Sicily. We enjoyed ten days touring that wonderful island and stayed at Agriturismos, farms that also accommodate visitors. The last Agriturismo we stayed at was an old olive farm called Fattoria Mose near the town of Agrigento. Every morning we climbed to the top floor of the building for breakfast. The buffet was spread out on large tables and I quickly noticed that the floor, which was quite extensive, was tiled with antique tiles. Interspersed among plain tiles were tiles depicting many species of birds. The birds had been hand-painted and had a distinctly folk-art appearance. Those birds on that Sicilian floor became the inspiration for 'Bird Dance'. As you sew your quilt I hope, like me, you experience a joyous sense of gratitude for all the delightful birds that enrich our lives. """

Our building designs should positively reinforce and facilitate the performance of the operations that they house. A facility should go beyond simply containing activities and should actually contribute to the productivity of our client's organization. This book describes the process and techniques of visualizing program information for architectural design in the dual sense of converting the information into graphic images and seeing or understanding the information better. The central thesis is that our ability to draw needs, requirements, and early design concepts is just as important as our ability to draw final building design solutions and that, in fact, our diagramming skills profoundly influence the quality of our building designs.,,"

According to government estimates, they contribute one-third of the total value-added in the transport sector. There are probably more than 750,000 of them, and they employ over one million people. Yet in the past rickshaws have been almost entirely overlooked by policy-makers and researchers. For example, both the Third and Fourth Five Year Plans devoted only a couple of lines to them. This oversight is largely because the rickshaws are seen as inefficient, inhumane, and a symbol of under-development. Due to this negative view, the official government policy is to phase them out as soon as possible, and replace them with motor vehicles. However, the rickshaws keep on increasing, and in the coming years their numbers will certainly rise. It would be best, therefore, to accept them, and plan for their future accordingly. This book was written to try and find practical ways of helping the people who operate the rickshaws, and the passengers who use them. Part One looks at the history of rickshaws, in Bangladesh and other countries. Part Two looks at the urban traffic problem, and compares the rickshaw with other modes in terms of efficiency, road safety, and effect on traffic congestion. Part Three looks at the scope for improving the rickshaw's technical design. Finally, Part Four looks at the people of the rickshaw industry, and their trade unions and co-operatives."

Stephen Ambrose, historian and presidential biographer
 
One of the epic treks of the human race. Shackleton, Franklin, Amundsen. . . . History is filled with people who have crossed immense distances and survived despite horrific odds. None of them, however, has achieved the extraordinary feat Rawicz has recorded. He and his companions crossed an entire continent--the Siberian arctic, the Gobi desert and then the Himalayas--with nothing but an ax, a knife, and a week's worth of food. . . . His account is so filled with despair and suffering it is almost unreadable. But it must be readand re-read.

Many of the songs she has recorded have become ""standards"" in the Christian music industry.  One of the most remarkable aspects of her many talents is the tremendous range of her voice.  However, since very few of us can hit those wonderful high notes with Sandi, we find it difficult to sing many of her arrangements.  In this book we have collected 37 of Sandi's best-loved songs and moved them into ranges more suitable for the medium-voiced singer.  In a few isolated cases, you will find that although a song has been moved to a lower key, it is still somewhat high for the average vocalist.  In these instances Sandi's arrangement covers such a wide range that there is a limit as to how much it can be lowered without moving the lowest notes out of range.  When this occurs, we have attempted to reach the best compromise possible while maintaining the integrity of the arrangement as Sandi Patti has recorded it.  [From the Publisher's Foreword]"

Krishnamurti has influenced millions throughout the 20th century, and his thoughts continue to resonate even a decade after his death. His words have influenced such notables as Dr. Jonas Salk, Aldous Huxley, Joseph Campbell, Van Morrison, Bruce Lee and countless other students of the spiritual path, ranging from scientists to philosophers to artists of all kinds. Practical, profound and timeless, Krishnamurti's ideas -- rejecting the prejudices of traditional learning, celebrating personal, spiritual freedom, and the individual&#39;s search for Truth -- are inspiring now more than ever. Collected in this comprehensive volume are the most illuminating and essential of his writings and talks: words that are of vital relevance to today&#39;s spiritual environment, and catalytic in guiding us toward a deeper understanding of ourselves, our place in the universe, and the mysteries of the human condition. <P> <I>Total Freedom</I> is both an introduction to Krishnamurti and an essential, extensive collection. It includes selections from his early work to his later, <I>Krishnamurti to Himself: His Last Journal</I>, and his valuable insight into the nature of the self, meditation, sex, love, and the mysteries of life and death. Revealing his core teachings in all their eloquence and power, these writings incite us to recognize that Truth is a pathless land, to accept no spiritual authority -- not even himself -- and to think critically, that we may free our minds and see clearly on our own personal journey. <P> As revolutionary now as ever, Krishnamurti remains, for independent minds, one of the most influential guides in the quest for spiritual understanding and enrichment. <P> ""[Krishnamurti&#39;s] language is naked, revelatory and inspiring.

At first glance the Madam seems a curious folk heroine. At second glance too. But San Francisco is a city that takes uncommon pride in its past sins, real or imaginary. The Madams of San Francisco is an examination of the myths that have arisen about the proprietresses of the city's famous parlor houses. From Mrs. Irene McCready, who opened her bordello in the fall of 1849; Ah Toy, the girl in the green silk pantaloons who operated very profitably throughout the 1850's; and Belle Cora, whose house was the most magnificent in the city, and who occasionally gave posh society soires as a change of pace from business as usual To the contemporary madam, now retired, who ran for the Sausalito City Council and finished third in a field of eight, these independent businesswomen of San Francisco have been something special in the folklore of American vice. The Madams of San Francisco covers one hundred years of the city's history, seen through the rise and fall of the parlor house. It presents a vivid picture of a party, glittering era, one that had more than its share of vices, but one whose men  and women  were a little larger than life. --- from book's dustjacket"

Critics were overwhelmedit will hold you, fascinate you, surround you (Chicago Tribune)and readers everywhere hoped for a sequel. Look out for the next book in this series, A Column of Fire, available now. World Without End takes place in the same town of Kingsbridge, two centuries after the townspeople finished building the exquisite Gothic cathedral that was at the heart of The Pillars of the Earth. The cathedral and the priory are again at the center of a web of love and hate, greed and pride, ambition and revenge, but this sequel stands on its own. This time the men and women of an extraordinary cast of characters find themselves at a crossroads of new ideasabout medicine, commerce, architecture, and justice. In a world where proponents of the old ways fiercely battle those with progressive minds, the intrigue and tension quickly reach a boiling point against the devastating backdrop of the greatest natural disaster ever to strike the human racethe Black Death. Three years in the writing and nearly eighteen years since its predecessor, World Without End breathes new life into the epic historical novel and once again shows that Ken Follett is a masterful author writing at the top of his craft."

Once everyone knew everyone else in the Selway, and events and characters became history.

However, because of its nature it can also be used effectively for self-study by anyone with the basic mathematical background of logarithms (for multiplication and division) and of algebra and trigonometry (for the remaining operations). For advanced students it can be a valuable reference for review and instruction in the more complex operations.' The book is aimed at scientific and engineering students; there is no mention of commercial or trades applications. Although a basic mathematical background is suggested, the completeness of the text should cover situations where the reader's background is a little weak. Also from the Preface, 'Pertinent mathematical concepts, such as decimal fractions, algebra, trigonometry, logarithms, notation by powers of ten, and approximate computation are either reviewed in the text or included in the Appendix for review. . . . . . The book's appendices enhance its value as a reference text. They include: The History of the Slide Rule, Exponential Relations, Logarithms, Standard Numbers (Scientific Notation), Significant Figures and Slide Rule Limitations, Slide Rule Adjustment and Care, Types of Slide Rules (circular, spiral, and cylindrical), Bibliography, 4-place Log Tables, and Tables of Trig Functions in Degrees and Decimals."

When Skagit Valley Herald invited people to share photographs of Skagit County through the 1960's, residents generously shared a piece of their own lives.  Some regretted that they knew only part of the story behind the pictures, and wished they had asked more when their parents were alive. In some cases, people called relatives from the newspaper's office, filling in the blanks in their knowledge of their own family history. The ensuing smiles spoke to the connection they had made. 
Those connections continue on the pages of this book. These pictures connect people to their pasts, to each other, to the present. Our only regret is that we didn't have the room to reprint every picture shared with us - at least not in this book.
Skagit County has grown tremendously in the past two decades because the rest of the world has discovered a community that still connects with each other. This book will help all of us appreciate the people who paved this path for us. To every one who contributed, thanks for sharing your treasured photographs that show the rich heritage of Skagit County. - L. Stedem Wood, Publisher, Skagit Valley Herald.'"

Ferguson, an overwhelmed and underprepared parent, shows off his wit and research skills as he tries to make sense of a serpentine system that has him debating if he needs to hire his own ,000-a-year college admission counselor. From there, Ferguson discusses everything from what lengths schools will go to rate highly in the U.S. News &amp; World Report college rankings guide to an outline of the ""history of American higher education."" In all this digging, Ferguson finds the many ""claims for and against"" the SATs, how the skyrocketing cost of college is creating its own education bubble, and that ""two out of every three"" freshman openings are filled before a ""general"" applicant even gets considered. Still, despite the funny moment like his disastrous retake of the SATs, it isn't till the book's final chapters, when the author starts to connect with his son, that it becomes apparent what they truly learned together on their quest for higher education.

In orthodox and catholic teachings, all Christians in heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered to be worthy of higher honor, emulation, or veneration
In the Anglican Communion and the Continuing Anglican movement, the title of Saint refers to a person who has been elevated by popular opinion as a pious and holy person. The saints are seen as models of holiness to be imitated, and as a 'cloud of witnesses' that strengthen and encourage the believer during his or her spiritual journey (Hebrews 12:1). The saints are seen as elder brothers and sisters in Christ. Official Anglican creeds recognise the existence of the saints in heaven.

So far as invocation of the saints is concerned, one of the Church of England's Articles of Religion ""Of Purgatory"" condemns ""the Romish Doctrine concerning...(the) Invocation of Saints"" as ""a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God"". However, each of the 44 member churches in the Anglican Communion are free to adopt and authorise their own official documents, and the Articles are not officially normative in all of them  Anglo-Catholics in Anglican provinces using the Articles often make a distinction between a ""Romish"" and a ""Patristic"" doctrine concerning the invocation of saints, permitting the latter.

In high-church contexts, such as Anglo-Catholicism, a saint is generally one to whom has been attributed (and who has generally demonstrated) a high level of holiness and sanctity. In this use, a saint is therefore not a believer, but one who has been transformed by virtue. In Roman Catholicism, a saint is a special sign of God's activity. Anglicans believe that the only effective Mediator between the believer and God the Father, in terms of redemption and salvation, is God the Son, Jesus Christ."

In so doing we aspire to set a new precedent. First and foremost Mozart's handwritten scores have been consulted, being the most important source. Moreover, we know today that in addition to Mozart;s own manuscripts, early copies in parts and prints also contain important information regarding the musical text. A co-production with Breitkopf & Hrtel, Mozart's piano concertos are not only available as attractive and affordable piano reductions, there are also an accompanying Urtext conductor's score, orchestral parts and a study score."

I wish also to call the attention of the brethren to the occasions of those of those disastrous results.""

Happy the man who sees good fruits from his labors. May he continue in this way and add yet more light, for in the matters of holiness there is always room to add and we have been commanded to add for they are linked to the Holy One who is infinite. May God grant him success, and enable him to improve and to add to this work, for the merit he brings the community supports him in his efforts. --Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe zl<br /><br />If the Bible is the cornerstone of Judaism, then the Talmud is the central pillar, soaring up from the foundations and supporting the entire spiritual and intellectual edifice. In many ways the Talmud is the most important book in Jewish culture, the backbone of creativity and of national life. No other work has had a comparable influence on the theory and practice of Jewish life, shaping spiritual content and serving as a guide to conduct. --Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz,Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz is a teacher, philosopher and spiritual mentor who has been hailed by Time Magazine as a once-in-a-millennium scholar. Born in Jerusalem in 1937, Rabbi Steinsaltz studied physics and chemistry at the Hebrew University. At the age of 24, he became Israel's youngest school principal. He established a network of schools in Israel and the former Soviet Union, and in 1988, was awarded the Israel Prize--his country's highest honor--for his work in Jewish education. In 1965, Rabbi Steinsaltz embarked on a lifelong mission to make the Talmud accessible to all. He has since translated and developed commentaries on the Talmud in modern Hebrew, English, Russian and French, revolutionizing the study of this central text of Jewish law, ethics, customs and history. In addition, Rabbi Steinsaltz has authored some 60 books and hundreds of articles on subjects ranging from theology to mysticism and social commentary.,,"

He pronounces Gods curse: ""No rain will fall on Israel until the people reject Baal and return to God."" God commands Elijah to escape to the desert in the east, where God provides water and food for him. Later, God commands Elijah to go and show himself to Ahab. Elijah tells Ahab to gather the prophets of Baal and meet him on Mount Carmel, where sacrifices are to be placed on two altars. ""Let us call on our gods,"" he says. ""The god that answers with fire is the true God."" The prophets of Baal cry out in vain. When Elijah prays humbly to God, God sends down fire.

Ms. Cassin knows her science and she has designed the book in an exciting, modern, chronological pattern; short but packed paragraphs and clearly demarcated changes in venue. Ann Pinson Cassin worked as an anthropologist and English teacher in Iceland for five years. She also was a science writer for The American Museum of Natural History, Science Service, and Scholastic Magazines. A short story, Hibernal Onding appeared in The Taj Mahal Review, December 2008. A short story, Mavis Lamb Needs Geologist for Oregon Gold Mine, was in the June through September 2011 monthly online journal issues of Long Story Short. She has a doctorate in anthropology from Stony Brook University and a master s degree in public health from the University of California, Berkeley. We are introduced to an archeological find a body belonging to a Middle Age s human, nearly fully preserved in the freeze of Iceland s climate, and nearly 500 years old. We meet our heroine Anthropologist Dana Eakin, described by Cassin as a natural blonde; she was crowned with angelic fluff her hair fell to her shoulders. We learn she must return to Iceland, after a letter from her father comes, urging her there, He has since gone missing Cassin brings us into the world of infectious disease, and the notoriously diverse world of characters a much bulkier novel usually presents. Her people are, at once real, and like flesh and blood counterparts, bear witness to Cassin s talent. Her arms and delicate legs, both limbs longer than her short torso, gave her both an enormous reach and great strides of equine grace. These assets will keep Dana out of the hands of what turns out to be a plot of enormous international scale and potential harm. Thus, Dana enters the contemporary world of Icelandic culture, and we too, along for the read. This is a woman in search of her father and colleague, and her unrelenting search of all who had any shred of evidence of his whereabouts, gets her into the lives of local Icelanders, some creative, many simply rough-hewn sailors, or farmers, all sagacious and aware of their Viking ancestry. --Mary Barnet<br /><br />From above the Arctic Circle comes Dana Eakin, a Dan Brown-style sleuth off to solve her first mystery, in this debut novel. The author Siri Hustvedt once described Iceland as a place where day never really became night. Cassin s book a kind of archaeological thriller takes place in that northerly nation, and it s a wonder that so many dark secrets can hide in a country where the sun almost never sets. Like a number of mysteries, the tale opens with a body, this one just barely peeking out from the thick ice. But the corpse is also nearly half a millennium old, and its slow thaw lets loose a bevy of dangers both ancient and modern. The author tasks a number of compelling characters with solving the body s mysteries, but none of these figures are as intriguing as Cassin s protagonist, Dana Eakin. Eakin is a remarkable new heroine a smart, young anthropologist whose scientific acumen just happens to make her an excellent detective. (Perhaps her most recent literary forebear is Sophie Neveu of The Da Vinci Code.) Cassin hints that this might be just the first of many Eakin novels, and if that s true, she s off to a superb start. This tale is intricate and inventive, and its source material Icelandic culture, epidemiology, lichenology is quite unusual. That is not to say there aren t some first-book wrinkles to iron out. Cassin has a tendency to overwrite. Once, when Eakin opens a heavy door, it is as though she were entering a vault. The author continues: That door was authentic archival vault material, and just a few lines later mentions the same vault-like doors. It s tough to hammer a metaphor home any harder. Furthermore, the chapters especially early on are so brief that the narrative sometimes gets disjointed. (By page 18, Cassin is already on Chapter 10.) It s as if the author is so excited by her project that she wants to tell readers all of it at the same time. But as the book stretches out, Cassin relaxes. Readers do, too, and the remainder of the work is a thrill and a delight. Audiences will surely hope that this won t be Eakin s only case. A distinctive page-turner starring a fine new detective. --Kirkus Review,Ann Pinson Cassin worked as an anthropologist and English teacher in Iceland for five years.

He made ground-breaking discoveries in the understanding of hysteresis that enabled engineers to design better electromagnetic apparatus equipment including especially electric motors for use in industry.

Panic spread among many listeners who believed the news reports of an actual Martian invasion. The resulting panic was duly reported around the world and disparagingly mentioned by Adolf Hitler in a public speech a few months later.

The group included some of the most important European artists of the second half of the twentieth century - Pierre Alechinsky, Karel Appel, Constant, Asger Jorn and Carl-Henning Pedersen - who collaborated in a search for a universal artistic language. Inspired by the creative impulse which they found in the art of so-called primitives, of children and of the insane, the group made idealistic, Marxist-inspired plans for a future in which a new folk art would be created. Cobra is the first detailed survey of the movement in English and provides a fascinating picture of this vibrant group of artists. Willemijn Stokvis reveals the different impact which Cobra had in Belgium, Denmark and Holland, and places the movement within the wider context of twentieth-century art, showing how it emerged from Surrealism and Expressionism and found a continuation in the politically engaged artistic movements of the 1950s and 1960s. The book reproduces an impressive selection of art work by Cobra artists in colour alongside black-and-white photographs of key archival material, and provides an essential introduction to this accessible and popular art."

He attended the Department of Oil Painting at Tohoku University of Art & Design and graduated in 2001. Takamatsu currently lives and works in Sendai, which was devastated by the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami back in 2011. The event can still be felt in Takamatsus work which mixes memories of sorrow with a deep sense of hope and spiritual positiveness in a spiral of emotions. Takamatsus depth-mapping technique is as unique as it is painstakingly intricate, the artist mixes traditional and modern techniques by fusing classic drawing, airbrush and gouache painting with computer graphics. Takamatsus creative process begins with Shadow/Deapth mapping, a sort of projective shadowing process by which shadows are added to 3D computer graphics used both in pre-rendered scenes, in realtime and many console and high-end PC games. Hand painted monochromed based objects are obtained using the method of mixing watercolor pigment with an opaque white pigment in a watercolor vehicle (made with gum arabic). It is traditionally referred to Gouache, a name coming from the Italian Guazzo, litterally meaning mud. Gouache is ideal for illustration and photoreproduction. Since the Gouache paint imparts most of the texture and these surfaces help to create a perfectly flat paint film on, Gouache paintings are typically done on hot pressed papers or smooth art boards. Takamatsu holograph-like effect is executed entirely by hand, using a methicolous thecnique in which every pixel on the object is a shade of gray that is proportional to its distance from the object looking at it. The match of these two techniques give a real sense of surrealism and astonishing depth. Since 2009 Takamatsu collaborates with the Tokyo-based Gallery Tomura, with whom he took part at Tokyo Art Fair and Art Asia Miami during Scope Art Fair. His art was also exhibited at Rias Ark Museum in Kesennuma  Miyagi. Takamatsu had also extremely successful solo and group exhibitions in USA-based established art galleries such as RoqLaRue in Seattle and Corey Helford in Los Angeles. With the Italy-based Dorothy Circus Gallery hes having the second solo exhibition (2013 and 2015) and he was featured in the institutional exhibition Lacrima Acquarium (2013) which took place at the Acquarium Museum  Casa dellArchitettura in Rome. On 2014 he conquered the Cover of the Hi Fructose magazine."

Transcending the Tibetan context, Longchenpa delivers a manual of wisdom for all people at all times and shows why the western world has turned to Tibet for its mystical inspiration during the last half century. This transmission of timeless wisdom of the Ancients of Tibet should take its place amongst the world's religious classics. Through the precept 'nonaction' - which is savoured like 'an old man basking in the sun' - Dzogchen teaches the natural perfection of all our experience, and all our lives, just as it is, without need of any alteration.

But when she gets lost along the way, and must travel through the jungle, she meets many animals whose names she must learn to write in school. This title is a sweet, if slightly too sweet, modern fairy tale set against the backdrop of very real conflict. At times, the light tone comes across as slightly cloying. But the story certainly entertains, and is complemented well by Azabal's bright, lovely illustrations. Younger children will likely relate to and enjoy Ayobami's perseverance to attend class. The framework of ""naming"" animals will also likely appeal to early elementary schoolaged children, particularly as they themselves are learning aboutand how to write the names ofvarious animals. The book would make for a good discussion starter. VERDICT A solid purchase for elementary school libraries.Maryanne Olson, Queens Borough Public Library, NY,""Sandwiched between endpapers of yellow-lined paper showing the upper- and lowercase cursive alphabet, this quiet story shouts the pricelessness of literacy.(...)<br />A marvelous tale of one girls passion for reading, writing, and learning."" ~ Kirkus Starred Review<br /><br /> () Younger children will likely relate to and enjoy Ayobamis perseverance to attend class. The framework of naming animals will also likely appeal to early elementary schoolaged children, particularly as they themselves are learning aboutand how to write the names ofvarious animals () A solid purchase for elementary school libraries. ~ School Library Journal<br /><br />""With the feel of an Aesops fable, this story is both empowering and reflective of the joy school can bring to children whose lives have been disrupted by war. Beautiful illustrations in graphite, watercolor, and colored pencil lend an ethereal, magical quality to this unnamed place, where dangerous creatures have endearing faces, and<br />letters of the alphabet flutter around Ayobami like protective stardust."" ~ Booklist"

Shell's practice has now survived for almost half a century and has had a huge influence on how businesses, governments, and other organisations think about and plan for the future.

They identify several principles that both define the process at Shell and help explain how it has thrived for so long. For instance, Shell scenarios are stories, not predictions, and are designed to help break the habit, ingrained in most corporate planning, of assuming that the future will look much like the present.,,"

Recently discovered by the author's daughter, it tells the story of Adele ""Kitty"" Robertson, young and energetic, but unprepared by her Radcliffe education for the rigors of apple farming in those bitter times. Alone at the end of a country road, with only a Great Dane for company, plagued by debts, broken machinery, and killing frosts, Kitty revives the old orchard after years of neglect. Every day is a struggle, but every day she is also rewarded by the beauty of the world and the unexpected kindness of neighbors and hired workers. Animated by quiet courage and simple goodness, The Orchard stands as a deeply moving celebration of decency and beauty in the midst of grim prospects and crushing poverty."

Upon arrival, she learns Dante was killed; she now has to figure out how to survive in a place with no opportunities for women. After many nights of listening to musicians playing on local streets, she picks up her violin and begs to be taught how to play the tango. This is a scandalous requestat this point in history, the tango is played only in brothels and back alley clubs, never in places frequented by respectable people, particularly women. Yet her request is granted. Rather than risk falling into poverty and prostitution, Leda takes her husband's clothing and name and decides to live as a man, which enables her to find work as a musician. Leda, now Dante, slips away to a distant neighborhood where no one knows her and begins her new life. The evolution of her life as a man and as a musician is told alongside the social history of Argentina as well as the history of the tango as it changes over time, affected by assorted cultural and class influences. Beautifully written erotic love scenes make this book better suited for older teens. VERDICT This lush story of love, passion, and tango will appeal to older teen fans of romance and historical fiction.Carla Riemer, Claremont Middle School, CA,&ldquo;<i>The Gods of Tango </i>opens up the imagination. . . .

The crooks in this story purchased properties with monies that were derived from criminal activities and deeded the properties into fictitious names thereby laundering their money into real assets.  The story is told by the author who discovered the complicated yet simple plan while investigating for the collection of a half-million dollar judgment order.

The main character suffers as she is the subject of a Mafia hit and is tormented until she ends up in jail herself and then in a mental institution.  She writes a book about her experience and exposes the truth about the corruption which abounds.  Her life then takes a dramatic turnaround after publishing her book.

This fast-paced saga of murder, mystery and mayhem leaves the reader appalled, angry and hungry for justice."

Vanhoenacker slips easily between poetic meditation into the nature of travel and technical explanations of the mechanisms of the 747, and I found all of it fascinating....The book&rsquo;s&#160;meditative pacing isn&rsquo;t dissimilar to the rhythms of flight itself, to the way landscapes gradually unspool far below. There&rsquo;s tremendous pleasure in coming across the&#160;explanations for aspects of flight I&rsquo;d never quite understood....It was easier, after reading it, to forget my exhaustion and the small annoyances of the world&#160;and lose myself again in&#160;the beauty of the flight.&rdquo;<br><br><b><u>Geoff Dyer, <i>The Guardian</i></u></b><br>""There is always something uplifting about people in love with their work, and on becoming an airline pilot Vanhoenacker (now a senior first officer with British Airways) seems to have attained a state of enviable grace....Beautifully, because simply, put. As&#160;the principles of aerodynamics act 'as&#160;a kind of natural sculptor' to&#160;create the elegance of aircraft design, so Vanhoenacker&rsquo;s prose has a&#160;functional eloquence that carries the&#160;reader along for the ride.""<br><br><b><u><b><u><i>The Times Literary Supplement</i></u></b><br></u></b>""A Senior First Officer flying 747s for British Airways, he explains that many pilots regard aeroplanes as 'the first thing they loved about the world'.

Mark Vanhoenacker has written the ideal book on the subject: a description of what it&rsquo;s like to fly by a commercial pilot who is also a master prose stylist and a deeply sensitive human being, familiar with great art and literature and always willing to tease out the psychologically resonant implications of his job. This is a man who is at once a technical expert (he flies 747s and Airbuses across continents) and a poet of the skies. This couldn&rsquo;t be more highly recommended.&rdquo;<br><br><b><u>James Fallows, author of&#160;<i>China Airborne</i></u></b><br>&ldquo;<i>Skyfaring</i>&#160;is a beautiful, revelatory work of observation, thought, and expression. The experience of traveling through the air, which would have seemed miraculous in any previous moment of human existence, has been drained of its wonder through the drear of the modern airline experience. From his seat in the front of the airplane, Mark Vanhoenacker captures and conveys the magic of seeing the world from above.&rdquo;<br><br><b><u>Patrick Smith, author of&#160;<i>Cockpit Confidential</i></u></b><br>""Mark Vanhoenacker is the thinking man's pilot, and his is a rare and refreshing perspective in an age when commercial flying is taken almost entirely for granted. Through prose as passionate and erudite as it is informative, he describes not merely the mechanical workings of flight, but will rekindle, in those who care to listen, a lost appreciation for the marvel of global air travel."" &#160;<br><br><b><u><i>The Times&#160;</i>(London)</u></b><br>&ldquo;A 330-page ode to the wonder of flight in the tradition of the great pioneer pilot-author Antoine de Saint Exup&eacute;ry and Charles Lindbergh....Like the best pilot writers, Vanhoenacker paints humanity seen from the aviator&rsquo;s perch, woven together with a fascinating layman&rsquo;s account of the mechanics of flight, the feat in which a 380-tonne jet can &lsquo;lift people and cargo away from the ground and across the sky&rsquo;....Vanhoenacker invokes philosophers, music, history, and his own past and family to convey the sense of discovery and disorientation that he feels crisscrossing the globe between Tokyo, Johannesburg, Los Angeles, London and the Arabian Gulf....a riveting practitioner&rsquo;s account of a human achievement that has been rendered humdrum by its own success.&rdquo;<br><b><br></b><i><b><u>The Scotsman</u></b><br></i>'Wonderfully evocative and clear-eyed...fascinating.'<br>&#160;<br><b><u>Giles Foden,&#160;<i>Conde Nast Traveller&#160;</i>(UK)</u></b><br>&ldquo;Not since Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry&rsquo;s classic <i>Vol de Nuit...</i>has there been such a fantastic book about flying as Mark Vanhoenacker&rsquo;s <i>Skyfaring: A Journey With a Pilot....</i>What marks this book out is its author&rsquo;s ability to bring a genuine poetic sensibility to the experience of flying and the feelings of strangeness and beauty that it engenders....<i>Skyfaring</i> takes the genre to a whole new level.

In elegant and balanced prose, he meditates on every aspect of aviation. The lift Vanhoenacker creates with his language is due to the carefully constructed machinery of each chapter &ndash; the way in which he balances personal narrative, research, and reverential reflection&hellip; It is an artful and elevated look at the soul in flight.&rdquo;<br><br><b><u><i>Kirkus</i>&#160;*starred review*</u></b><br>""This pilot is an accomplished stylistic acrobat who flies&mdash;and writes&mdash;with the greatest of ease. The anatomy of an airliner and peripatetic aerial travel, as well as sophisticated worldview, combine for first-class reading&mdash;sure to enhance your next flight.""<br><br><b><i><u>Publishers Weekly</u></i></b><br>&ldquo;In this intimate, often illuminating piece,&#160;<i>Slate</i>&#160;columnist Vanhoenacker takes readers on a personal tour of his world as an airline pilot....Vanhoenacker conveys that sense of freedom, wanderlust, and traversing a large world made small by travel, while at the same time demystifying the inside of the cockpit and humanizing the all-powerful pilots within....Packed with eloquent insight into a high-flying world.&rdquo;,,<b>MARK VANHOENACKER</b> is a pilot and writer. A regular contributor to <i>The New York Times</i> and a columnist for <i>Slate,</i> he has also written for <i>Wired, </i>the <i>Financial Times, </i>the<i> Los Angeles Times,</i> and <i>The Independent</i>.

Rens's views on organisations have been shaped by his work as a consultant in both the for-profit and non-profit sector, his work with elite athletes, the perspectives from both the hard and soft side of business, and probably through his millennial generation.,Rens has a degree in social psychology and sport psychology (both from the University of Amsterdam), as well as in business (Harvard Business School). He has worked as a management consultant for McKinsey &amp; Company and continues to practice as a sports psychologist with athletic teams. He also greatly enjoys serving on the advisory boards of young start-ups.,In his free time, Rens can be found on the water, wave surfing or kitesurfing, or high in the mountains. He also enjoys reading and spending time with family and friends. Although a global citizen, he calls Amsterdam, The Netherlands, his home.,,,"

This collection is a personal appreciation and piercing analysis of those who do it sublimely: Edgar Allan Poe, Emily Dickinson, Jean Stafford, Roald Dahl (considered in his adult work), Shirley Jackson, Flannery O'Connor, Cormac McCarthy, Philip Roth, Claire Messud, and others. Oates is drawn to writers and themes that inform her own work, such as the gothic, the satiric, feminist theory, and a humanist bent that seems to have gone out of fashion. Readers of the <I>New York Review of Books</I>, the <I>New Yorker</I>, or <I>TLS</I> will be familiar with these essays (though sometimes in different form or with different titles), divided into three parts&mdash;Classics, Contemporaries, and Nostalgias. Some essays&mdash;on the smothered brothers, Homer and Langley Collyer; on boxing; on Annie Leibovitz&mdash;are not strictly literary. In the Nostalgias section, Oates skewers American jingoism, notes the influence of Lewis Carroll on childhood, and returns to her source, Lockport, N.Y. Oates attributes the book's existence to the death of her husband of 48 years (reading gave shape to her uncharted life as a widow), but it is inspired as much by the subjects Oates so astutely describes. <I>(June 29)</I> <BR>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,Oates knowing and voluptuously inquisitive journeys through books reveal glimpses of her private self and map her inspirations and feelings of kinship with other writers. Her latest collection of reviews and essays is the most poignant, open, and trusting to date. The title, Oates tells us, refers to the imagined worlds limned by writers under her scrutiny, including Poe, Flannery OConnor, Shirley Jackson, Roahl Dahl, Margaret Atwood, and Annie Proulx. But rough country is also where Oates found herself when her husband of 48 years died suddenly in early 2008. Oates found solace in reading and in writing these illuminating and fluent essays. A relaxed yet erudite and exacting critic, she is nimble in her assessment of Nabokov and avidly forensic in her dissection of Salman Rushdie. Her keen eye extends to visual art, and her response to Annie Leibovitzs retrospective exhibition and book, A Photographers Life (2009), is clarion. Most captivating and poignant are Oates personal essays, particularly her gracefully revealing portrait of Lockport, New York Normal 0 MicrosoftInternetExplorer4 /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:Table Normal; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family:Times New Roman;}a place crucial to her exceptional sensibility. --Donna Seaman"

What she found was a level of sexual exhilaration beyond anything she'd even imagined. <P> Here is her moment-to-moment journal as she enters the downward spiral necessary to bare her soul and debase herself for her master. Madelaine's experiences were extremely wild, edgy, and on the most advanced level of play: private fantasy enactments, public scenes in nightclubs, frolics both fun and fearsome at exclusive dungeon parties--almost nothing was off-limits. Madelaine found her sexual boundaries pushed further and further as she accessed desires unknown even to herself. Exploring her submissive nature and her emotions more deeply, she was changed into one who would do anything for her cruel, handsome master, ultimately striving to make his base and often savage desires her own. <P> Read as a vicarious pleasure, a primer of new fantasies, or as a companion to Varrin's <i>Erotic Surrender</i>, this sexy volume is a must for everyone who is captivated by the outer limits of human sexuality and pleasure."

From 1936 to 1972 the weekly publication of Life served as the nation's foremost authority on cultural trends and the state of the American experience. It ceased publication until 1978, when it returned as a monthly until the year 2000. Since then Life has returned as a weekly, published in 70 newspapers across the nation. The company is also well-known for its many books on photography, writing and, in conjunction with Time, many self-help and 'how to' volumes. Life magazine continues to be one of the most important publications in the country, both for its current issues as well as its back catalog. Researchers, designers, and the simply curious use Life magazine as a reference for style, trends, celebrity news, as well as the award-winning photography that first made the publication famous. By now there is hardly anybody in the United States who isn't familiar with both the logo (white lettering on a red rectangle) as well any number of photographs first published in the magazine, like the famous V-Day kiss in Times Square. Life magazine is dedicated to continuing its place in American publication history, and back issues of the magazine can fetch considerable figures if in good condition. The magazine has gone from being simply another magazine to a sought-after collectible. Collections of Life magazine are often found at auction. Where Life will go in the future is unknown, but its resiliency has proven to be formidable, and most experts agree that Life will remain an iconic, growing force in American culture for years to come."

It is an aid to all who wish to practise the Jesus Prayer, and makes clear how essential this Prayer is in our life. In a systematic and simple way it explains that before the Fall prayer was done effortlessly, like the unending glorification of the angels, but since the Fall strungle and effort have been required. Great attention and watchfulness are needed in order for the believers nous to remain in God. As he replies to the writers questions, the hermit, who has seen God, explains how mans nous enters the heart, and there prayer acts automatically. This is called noetic prayer or prayer of the heart. There is an account of the Stages of the Jesus Prayer, of how, in other words, this sacred work of prayer unfolds. The ways in which it differs from intellectual prayer and from Yoga and other Eastern religious methods are emphasized. Explanations are given of The Advent and Withdrawal of Grace and The Fruits of the Jesus Prayer, which are the unification of the whole of man, divine consolation and blessedness in the midst of lifes trials. We are informed of the dangers and delusions which are likely to arise in the course of the Jesus Prayer, with reference to tears, psychotechnic methods, and the complex warfare waged by the devil to hinder the person praying from doing this work of prayer. Emphasis is laid on the supreme importance and value of obedience to a spiritual father and guide in order to avoid delusion. Through studying the whole discussion we come to understand what the passions are, and how essential it is that we struggle to purify our soul from them and acquire an awareness of our sinfulness.,,"

Bladesmiths employ a variety of metalworking techniques similar to those used by blacksmiths, as well as woodworking for knife and sword handles, and often leatherworking for sheaths. Bladesmithing is an art that is thousands of years old and found in cultures as diverse as China, Japan, India, Germany, Korea, the Middle East, and the British Isles. As with any art shrouded in history, there are myths and misconceptions about the process. While traditionally, bladesmithing referred to the manufacture of any blade by any means, the majority of contemporary craftsmen referred to as bladesmiths are those who primarily manufacture blades by means of using a forge to shape the blade as opposed to knifemakers who form blades by use of the stock removal method, although there is some overlap between both crafts.,We have scoured the internet far and wide to put together this unique combination of information for the want to be bladesmith and even the more advanced.

It was heard on CBS from 1942 through 1962. Approximately 945 episodes were broadcast during its long run, and more than 900 are extant in mostly high-quality recordings Suspense went through several major phases, characterized by different hosts, sponsors and director/producers. There were a few rules which were followed for all but a handful of episodes: Protagonists were usually a normal person suddenly dropped into a threatening or bizarre situation. Evildoers must be punished in the end. The program made only occasional forays into science fiction and fantasy. Among its science fiction entries were ""The Man who Went Back to Save Lincoln"" (a time travel fantasy) and an adaptation of Curt Siodmak's Donovan's Brain. Alfred Hitchcock directed its audition show (for the CBS series Forecast). This was an adaptation of ""The Lodger,"" a story Hitchcock had filmed in 1926 with Ivor Novello. Martin Grams, Jr., author of Suspense: Twenty Years of Thrills and Chills, described the Forecast origin of Suspense: On the second presentation of July 22, 1940, Forecast offered a mystery/horror show titled Suspense. With the co-operation of his producer Walter Wanger, Alfred Hitchcock received the honor of directing his first radio show for the American public. The condition agreed upon for Hitchcock's appearance was that CBS make a pitch to the listening audience about his and Wanger's latest film, Foreign Correspondent. To add some flavour to the deal, Wanger threw in Edmund Gwenn and Herbert Marshall as part of the package. All three men (including Hitch) would be seen in the upcoming film, which was due for a theatrical release the next month. Both Marshall and Hitchcock decided on the same story to bring to the airwaves, which happened to be a favorite of both of them: Marie Belloc Lowndes' ""The Lodger."""

When Mr. Stone died he had only one relative, his grandson, Graham. Graham had been informed that he was to have the one thing of value on the farm, known only as mystery boy. Unfortunately, no one knew who or what mystery boy was. The Hollisters, therefore, were quite surprised to find that the hobby-horse they purchased at the sale held the key to the identity of this strange bequest. This, however, is a minor mystery, for when the Hollisters visit Pony Hill Farm, a horse farm owned by cousins of Mrs. Hollister, Ruth and Charles Thomas, they all become concerned with a beautiful appaloosa pony that appears at the farm as if out of nowhere. The solution of this puzzle and that of the elusive Graham Stone, along with learning trick riding and entering the County Fair Horse Show, makes a new Hollister story of interesting and unusual adventure.,,"

When he returned home to Australia his stories were discovered and published to world-wide acclaim. These 19 stories are based on Paul White's personal experiences of doctoring in Africa.

The Jungle Doctor books are about the work to bring health and wellbeing to Africa as well as the good news of Jesus Christ and salvation!

Each book features exciting stories of what it was like to be a missionary doctor fighting to save people's lives, while the traditional African witchdoctors often brought sickness, evil potions, fear, and even death to the people. While working to save the people of Africa from disease, wild animals, and more, the Jungle Doctor tells the people about Jesus, often explaining Bible stories through fables. Soon, some of the people of Tanzania see the power of the missionary's God.

In 1993, as a result of receiving a Divine Command from Lord Lakulish, Himself, Swami Rajarshi Muni temporarily interrupted his secluded sadhana to undertake a worldwide campaign to spread the knowledge of Yoga and the moral, cultural and spiritual values of the Sanatan (eternal) Indian heritage. He resumed secluded sadhana in 2007 to complete his Yoga and to establish the authenticity of the principle of the indestructible Divine Body, on which he has shed profound light from a position of eminent qualification based on personal practice and experience.

I had to write this book to find out how the four levels of MOQ can be defined and used practically. I found that the lowest common denominator of these levels is time. Saved time. Time is NOT money. Instead  money is SAVED time. Tremendous efforts are expended every day, globally, on making money, i.e. saving time for the customer. Much more effort than is spent on the thing that the saved time is intended to be used for. One can meditate for a long period on where this saved time originates from. To engage in that kind of meditation takes a lot of saved time. Saved time that is kept locked up and not used is worse than time wasted on things that don't directly give something back, like art, music, sleeping and dreaming  things that make life worth living. Saved time is also the ultimate basis for cosmological evolution, as the best way to arrange energy and particles in a vibrating string, atoms and molecules. As the best strategy for survival in competition with other species. As the best way to organize society and as the best way to explain what it's all about. Any event in our everyday life depends on the four levels of the MOQ and the differences between them. It was very amusing to find out what kind of trouble an uneven couple can get into regarding that. Deterioration through age is the reason events and individuals don't continue forever. Therefore every species has some kind of reproductive system so that commonly developed strategies can be handed down to fresh new copies of the group. Among humans, this is called sexual activity. In some retarded social areas, however, erotica and sexuality are banned from being discussed openly by those that are afraid of losing control, those who try to control society for their own benefit. These people do their best to keep you away from reality. They make you scared of it and they do what they can to turn you on with just about anything other than love, reason and your own desire. Don't let them rape your mind.,,"

He is consumed by a passion for living a long healthy life, and wants his readers to share that passion. Their health and well-being comes first. He is anti-dogmatic, and unwavering in his dedication to improve the quality of life of his readers. He has been called ""the conscience of modern medicine,"" a ""medical maverick,"" and his medical experiences are far reaching-from battling malaria in Central America - to fighting deadly epidemics at his own health clinic in Africa - to flying with U.S. Navy crews as a flight surgeon - to working for 10 years in emergency medicine in the United States. This dedicated physician has repeatedly gone far beyond the call of duty in his work to spread the truth about integrating the best science-based medical therapies from all medical disciplines (""alternative medicine""). For a full year, he endured economic and physical hardship to work with physicians at the Pasteur Institute in St. Petersburg, Russia, where advanced research on photoluminescence was being conducted. These learning experiences and his keen storytelling ability and wit make Dr. Douglass' numerous books on this website and his newsletters - The Douglass Report and Daily Dose - uniquely interesting and fun to read. He shares his no-frills, ""no-bull"" approach to health care, often amazing his readers by telling them to ignore many widely-hyped good-health practices (like staying away from red meat, avoiding coffee, and eating like a bird), and start living again by eating REAL food, taking some inexpensive supplements, and doing the pleasurable things that make life livable. Readers of Dr. Douglass books and newsletters get all this, plus they learn how to burn fat, prevent heart disease and cancer, boost libido, and so much more. And Dr. Douglass is not afraid to debunk latest research reports that are published, and share the real story with his readers. He has led a colorful, rebellious, and crusading life! Not many physicians would dare put their professional reputations on the line as many times as this courageous healer has. A vocal opponent of ""business-as-usual"" medicine, Dr. Douglass has championed patients' rights and physician commitment to wellness throughout his career."

                          CURSES

       HIDDEN SOURCE OF TROUBLE IN 

               THE CHRISTIAN'S LIFE

                       THE ANSWER

    WHY MANY BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO 

                      GOOD PEOPLE 

                      THE PROBLEM

Are you one of the many victims of an unbroken curse? Today, countless Christians throughout the world are plagued by unexplained poverty, calamities, and a variety of adverse circumstances. Their lives are tragically filled with heartache and desperation as they continuously struggle against overpowering temptation, physical and mental illness, and a myriad of catastrophic events. Usually they are unaware that their plight is the result of an unbroken curse which has been placed upon them and perhaps upon their families. 

              SOME OF THE CAUSES

 Hatred and jealousy

 Trespassing on the Devil's territory

 Handling unholy things 

 Inherited curses

 Breaking vows to God

                     THE SOLUTION 

The Bible specifically instructs every believer to avoid curses and to recognize and break them. Yet, an astonishing number of Bible-believing Christians have either not read or do not remember these essential spiritual principles. Thus, many believers live under the affliction of unbroken curses. This book will show you the necessary biblical steps to recognize, prevent, and break every type of curse."

Indeed, one of his earliest recollections is intimately connected with Asian politics---lopped-off heads in a basket, exposed to discourage the opposition. And as it happens his wife, who is a journalist too, also has an Eastern background, for she was brought up in Saigon. Lucien Bodard, therefore, possesses a vast store of knowledge, the immensely detailed ramifying knowledge that comes from having been there for years and years with open ears and eyes and a sharply intelligent, trained inquiring mind---knowledge of a very different kind from that which is amassed in a few weeks by newspapermen who fly into Saigon with a load of hurried reading and preconceived ideas.""

Firman and Gila present a comprehensive account of psychosynthesis, providing a transpersonal integration of developmental, personality, and clinical theory. They reveal some of the relationships between psychosynthesis and contemporary developmental research, object relations theory, intersubjective psychology, trauma theory, the recovery movement, Jungian psychology, humanistic and transpersonal psychology, and common psychological diagnoses. Case examples and practical theory designed to support both the layperson and the professional seeking to understand and facilitate psychospiritual growth are included.

It offers guiding principles for living with purpose and dignity. Although we respect others, this is not a book about Judaism (Talmud, Torah), for we are not Hebrew; it is not a book about Christianity (Bible, New Testament), for we are not European; nor is it a book about Islam (Quran, Hadith), for we are not Arabs. They wrote (and/or assembled) their own books in the Levant, Rome, and the deserts of Arabia; they created their own religions and gods; and they made their own relics of morality, while conquering and enslaving nearly two-thirds of the world. African morality and ethics antedated the Hebraic Torah, European Bible, and Arabic Quran by thousands of years. And yet, every moral or religious idea they didnt write in their books is belittled as being inferior (e.g. pagan, kafir, acum) while those that are in their books are considered sacred scriptural emanations prophetically revealed exclusively to them by the gods they, themselves, gave names to. One could accept this, fit into existing arrangements, abandon truth, fall in line as obedient dotard dilettantes misleading the already misled, then just try to get along bowing and scraping as servile connoisseurs of everyone elses morality but our own. Or one could fight it, assimilate/redeem/restore our own ancestral wisdom into a creative synthesis, rebuild indigenous moral canon, and in so doing move future generations onto the path again to inner reflection and self-correction. In sum, our aim in preparing this book is to serve as a bridge, a portal, a medium for transmitting the transcendental wisdom of our ancestors across centuries---to absorb the best from preceding epochs, molding those into an enlightening repository of guiding principles."

Crips white curtains at the windows, soft neutral colors on the walls, a pootery jug filled with summer-blue hydrangeas, and the feeling of coziness created by a family enjoying life to the fullest - these are the treasured qualities of bungalow living.

Planning a cottage interior offers an opportunity to showcase lavish displays of heirloom treasures and fabulous flea-market finds.  Liberal use of various shades of white, gray, and palest taupe, combined with antique linens, wicker chairs, plump cushions, and abundant flowers, creates a welcoming, relaxed environment.  Add to your home's ambience with an unexpected twist, such as leather-and-wood furnishings used on a sun-dappled terrace.  ""Crowded simplicity"" is the motto for this decor.

You'll enjoy the inspirational photography from the archives of Victoria, and the beautiful work of the renowned Toshi Otsuki.  Also included are images from Pierre Chanteau, Christopher Drake, Michael Skott and many others.  

Let this special issue of Classic Cottages be the visual guide for creating the delightful home of your dreams."

He had a hand in it, working for his father who was one of the original canal contractors and built several sections of ""Clinton's ditch"" near Rochester, New York.  Many times I have regretted that I made no notes of what the old gentleman told us.  After this lapse of years, I cannot claim that my memory of his stories is exact in detail.  But the passages in this book, descriptive of the methods of construction and early operation in the canal, as Grandfather Adams gave us his word-of-mouth history, are, I believe, a faithful picture of that great enterprise."""

These pages reflect the development of the unique Persona Stamp Exchange style. We are pleased to share with you my collection of creative ideas we have developed over the years of working and evolving together. For us, rubber stamping is about fun and enjoyment, personal and artistic communication, and creating visceral pleasure for people you care about. Our wish is to inspire you with hundreds of breath-taking designs and how-to photographs that will increase your confidence to make your own creative sentiments. For your convenience, the enclosed Project Guide will help you experiment and become comfortable with the many techniques we use. Included are many paper Projects, ranging from simple to sophisticated to slightly whimsical. Water coloring has been a favorite medium for us this year. Fabric stamping embellished with exquisite yet simple embroidery is another fun direction we have been exploring. The memory keeping ideas for photo frames and scrapbooks became personally very gratifying for us, for we have filled many pages with our own family and friends. I want to thank all of you for being loyal PSX customers over the years. It is you who have inspired us to continue producing the most detailed and beautiful designs and highest quality rubber stamps along with out-standing service. Your thoughtful letters, creative stamping ideas, kind words and thoughts and suggestions on how to improve have helped us become who we are.

A tangled web has left her feeling like she has no friends at all. And to make matters worse, Finnian Jones has just diagnosed her with a curable, yet highly contagious condition that requires special treatment: a major shift in focus. For the first time Jessica is about to experience the legendary wonder of the Exploratorium as Finnian hands her a tattered edition of The Basket of Flowers. Inside the pages of this rare and aged book... Mary is falsely accused of stealing, and the penalty is death. She had always been taught that it is better to die for the truth than to live for a lie-for the worst pillow to sleep on is the pillow of a guilty conscience. Will the darkest and most dreadful night help Mary find God for herself or will she live in the shadow of a faith that is not her own? This is a story that will cause you to shed a tear or two and at the same time cultivate a hope that will never disappoint!

He describes several orchid ""hotspots""?e.g., The Northeast Kingdom (Vermont) and the Route 128 arc around Boston?including such unusual habitats as bogs and sand/gravel excavations near roads, which support certain orchid species. This book would be a natural for libraries in the region, but librarians may wish to compare it with William Chapman's Orchids of the Northeast (Syracuse Univ., 1996). Weeds of the Northeast is a more specialized reference to 298 species of weeds in agriculture, nurseries, gardens, turf areas, landscapes, and roadways. Entries detail the appearance of seedling and mature plants, flowers and fruits, habitat, distribution, and similar species. Special features include identification keys based on characteristics such as thorns, milky sap, and type of leaf; a dichotomous key to all described species; a grass identification table; and comparison tables for easily confused species. This book would certainly be valuable for identifying weeds in the region defined as Maine south to Virginia and west to Ohio and Wisconsin, but it does not provide guidance for controlling or eliminating them.

Each listing contains a detailed description of the orchid, its habitat, blooming dates, measurements, and abundance (rare to frequent), and a map showing where the species can be found. There are 192 lavish color photographs, 94 black-and-white drawings by Stan Folsom, a state-by-state checklist, and a glossary. <i>George Cohen</i>"

Phil worked hard, but he played even harder. With his thunderous motorcycles, tempestuous marriages, and drug-fueled parties, his life on shore could have served as a reality show in itself.

Born into a litter of 16, the scruffy protagonist is the pup not chosen&mdash;the ""saddest and the baddest."" His solitude, however, facilitates his sensitivity to the sounds that permeate his urban environment, and while the ""clatter makes him gladder,"" ultimately it's the strains of opera that motivate him to ""bark it like Brunhilda."" Raschka's musicality undergirds his street-savvy lingo, making the narrative fresh and lyrical. The font becomes bigger and bolder to indicate emphasis, a technique that is particularly helpful when the text spirals around the pages. ""I'm the zoom-est and the boom-est, spread no gloom-est, say no doom-est. I'm the top-est, never stop-est, Boston Pop-est, be be bop-est. I jazzle dazzle like it as the Hip Hop Dog."" Radunsky's caricatures of the moves of a canine version of Snoop Dogg manage to be convincing, poignant, and funny&mdash;no small feat. Loose lines, brushwork that allows the textured background to show through, and occasional bits of collage combine to create a gritty cityscape peopled with quirky personalities. This story of a neglected orphan who sings and struts his way to happiness will gladden the hearts of readers young and old.&mdash;<I>Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public Library</I> <BR>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,This phat collaboration applies the best qualities of hip hop to a doggy allegory celebrating self-esteem. Born one mutt out of many, a canine rapper is the saddest and the baddest in town. He feels unwanted and unloved until he discovers music and begins to bark it like Brnhilda. Finding positive empowerment in his talent, he uses words to mark my territory, / Turning heads on all the breeders; / When I make it auditory, / If theres a pack, then Im the leader. Soon hes the coolest, go to school-est pup around. This is great for reading aloud, particularly with kids who love hip hop and those who may experience similar feelings of insecurity. The well-matched mixed-media illustrations show lively urban scenes, with the star of the show in a black baseball cap turned backward (is that angle OK in your neighborhood?) spinning and dancing around with other pooches and people, all against colorful backgrounds. Kids will want to chant along to the text, which slides and swirls across the pages with a contagious beat. Preschool-Grade 2. --Andrew Medlar"

All the graduating batches are like the exploding seedpods of Balsam. Amongst the various seeds that were dispersed to the different corners of the world, he landed in the holy land of Gujarat. Having completed his MBA in Marketing from the acclaimed Maharaja Sayajirao University, he works in Baroda for a private company.Bitten by the world of magical realism of a Garcia Marquez, Thriller tales of a Maclean or an Archer, nationalistic fervour of a Tharoor or a Nilekani, he finally took his dive to the deep ocean of writing.

These combined talents have made him uniquely successful in communicating the depth and relevance of Torah to thousands of Jews from all over the world. <b>--Rabbi Noah Weinberg</b>,<b>Friends, there is nothing exactly like this work on the market and I high recommend it</b> for several reasons. First, it represents the best tradition of what I can term 'Intellectual Modern Orthodoxy' of the sort one finds among the best students of the Rav and Rav Aharon. Second, it is eminently readable in articulate, colloquial English, despite the depth of its ideas. Third, it is made to be studied. Rabbi Kahn has done something I wish others would copy; he provides citations from the rabbinic sources and classical to which he refers, with the original text and his own careful translations below the text. Going away for Shabbos? Pack this book in your bag. You can read the essays and then review the sources to which Rabbi Kahn's presentation refers. Fourth, Rabbi Kahn is an astute reader of the text with a broad mastery of rabbinic literature. His choices are always good. Fifth, he is a master teacher. Nothing here is trite or unsophisticated. Thinking readers will profit enormously.,<b>I only review books that I love. I love Echoes of Eden and cannot wait to learn more from Rabbi Kahn.</b> The book is published by Gefen and OU Press. As ever, their work befits the superior content within its covers. --<b>Rabbi Ozer Glickman, Facebook post</b><br /><br />My friend and colleague Rabbi Ari Kahn is gifted with the natural ability to extract-combine-create Torah that provokes mind and heart to reach new levels of awe and appreciation of the beauty of the intertwining of the totality of Torah with itself. May the author continue to inspire us all with his beautiful creative works of Torah. --<b>Rabbi Yitzchak Berkovitz</b><br /><br />.. brilliantly, and with integrity. It also captivates the reader-learner. It focuses the teachings of the Midrash masterfully on a wide range of the existential-intellectual dilemmas of our time. --<b>Rabbi Nachman Bulman, Jerusalem</b>,Rabbi Ari Kahn received his rabbinic ordination from Yeshiva University's Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, where he studied with Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik. He graduated Yeshiva University with a BA in psychology and an MS degree in Talmud. He is the director of Foreign Student Programs at Bar-Ilan University in Israel and is a senior educator at the Aish HaTorah College for Jewish Studies and Matan. Rabbi Kahn is also vice president of Migdal Ohr Institutions in Israel, He has authored over two hundred articles on the weekly parshah and holidays, with a readership in excess of ten thousand. He is also the author of Explorations, an in-depth analysis of the weekly Torah reading, and Emanations, an in-depth analysis of the Jewish holidays. Rabbi Kahn is also a renowned speaker and has lectured worldwide. He has lived in Israel since 1984 with his wife Naomi and five children.,,"

If it is true that an English king or queen reigns but does not govern and that the French President does neither, it may well be argued that the American President, an officer unique among the governments of the world, does both.  However bitter the electoral campaign, the winning candidate becomes President not alone of his own partisans but of all the people.  The degree to which a given President translates this myth into reality is one measure of his greatness.  When the myth breaks down as it did in 1861, and the rival forces stand at arms violent rebellion and civil war become the price of national salvation.  Mr. Hyman suggests some measures of reform in this book and makes a substantial contribution to our understanding of this most important and baffling institution."

As I grew older, it was my doll that found shelter there while I wandered through the berries after butterflies.  When I became tired, I would crawl under the shade and fall asleep with my doll wrapped in my arms.  Here my Mother would find us, both faces smeared with berries."

Time after time, Tromp discovers that key agents allow their judgment to be guided by their own financial interest. In day-to-day practice, the ethics of this behavior is not questioned either in the courts, the art trade or the art-historical literature.,Based on prodigious research, Henk Tromps work provides a fascinating case study of the problem of authenticity. This question of what is real and what is true extends far beyond the realm of art history and may be the most difficult cultural and moral issue all of us face today.,,Vincent van Goghs paintings and drawings are fabulously expensive. Millions of people admire his work, but are those masterpieces all genuine? To this day, the international art world struggles to separate the real Van Goghs from the fake ones, and the key question addressed in this book is what may happen to art experts when they publicly voice their opinions on a particular Van Gogh (or not). The story starts with art expert J.B. de la Faille who discovered to his own bewilderment that he had included dozens of fake Van Goghs in his 1928 catalogue raisonn. He wanted to set the record straight, but met with strong resistance from art dealers, collectors, critics, politicians and others, marking the beginning of a fierce clash of interests that had seized the art world for many decades of the twentieth century. In his fascinating account of the struggle for the genuine Vincent van Gogh, Tromp shows the less attractive side of the art world. His reconstruction of many such confrontations yields a host of intriguing and sometimes bewildering insights into the fates of art experts when they bring unwelcome news.,,"

Numa encruzilhada de turistas e imigrantes, Magnus abre uma agencia de passeios por locais mal-assombrados de Dublin, todos inventados por ele.

Starting with coffee, we see Rufus start his day by playing piano (in his underwear no less) dashing off to Boston via train, where he connects with his sister Martha and her son Archangelo. We follow through sound check, a pre-show meal, more piano practice and preparing for the stage. The book then bursts into gorgeous color images as Rufus takes to the stage of  Bostons famed Opera House and dazzles the crowd with his performance of All Days are Nights, Songs for Lulu as a song cycle  featuring haunting films projected behind him by artist Douglas Gordon. A quick break, then back to the stage where Rufus performs a selection of his favorite songs. The book then returns us to the black and white world: a post show autograph session, visitors in the dressing room, and finally back to bed on the tour bus  ready to sleep and dream and be carried to the next city . This book is a must have for any fan of Rufus Wainwright, with beautiful text by Rufus himself, as well as an introduction by Cherry Vanilla"

This Mantra Therapy CD is designed for retraining your subconscious in positive ways to heal from anorexia and bulimia.

Opening Precaution--Mantra Therapies are no substitute for conventional, traditional or ancient forms of medical care. If you have a problem, be sure to consult the health care practitioner of your choice.  Background--Minor difficulties can be affected in two weeks. More deeply rooted problems can take from 40-120 days to begin to achieve noticeable results. So although you may desire immediate results, most results take time to manifest. How Mantras Work--Mantras work directly on karma - accumulated inborn tendencies in the body. The mantras' vibrations work through the chakras to increase the flow of beneficial energy throughout the subtle body. Mantra therapy increases the energy available for our activities. Certain mantras used singly or in combination can greatly accelerate the quality and quantity of energy used in the healing process. However, if the karma for a given condition is overwhelming, mantra therapy will not remove the difficulty any more than conventional therapy will. However, mantra therapy work will lessen the karmic baggage you take into future lives. The energy mantra practice produces may lead one to forms of therapy quite different from the ones used initially. Thus, some unexpected new form of treatment, conventional or not, may appear as fruit of mantra practice. Investigate it. How To Conduct Your Mantra Intensive-- Practice ALL mantras in the therapy session for 108 times each (one mala) in one sitting. It will take about one hour to complete. Do the practice every day for a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of 40 days. The full forty-day program will produce the best results. Be patient and diligent. For deep-seated problems, a 120-day program is recommended. At the end of your program, stop daily chanting and take a break for at least one week."

One, it contains a great deal of quality original material, songs that will have you really listening to the lyrics. Too often, it seems gospel CDs have a tendency to be filled with songs that invite a capella arrangements, but otherwise are generally weak in the lyrics department. Not so with the compositions here, including the a capella offering of Gloryland,a public domain tune performed by whaley and Helton. That track is followed by a wonderful Easter Brothers song, Thank You, Lord. The simple but effective version of the old Carter Family classic, Workin On A Building, is also difficult not to like.<P>The other standout quality of The Back of the Book is the genuine, earthy vocals that Helton and Whaley contribute. Rest assured that if this group had been pegged to compete in the commercial country market, studio-hired vocal coaches would have ruined these two fine vocalists. In the bluegrass genre, honest and powerful voices like these are allowed to stand on their own, unpolished merits. May it always be so.

Few subjects are so guaranteed to pique the reader's curiosity as the story of the one priest in five who leaves the priesthood and the Roman Catholic Church. Spoiled Priest, being the autobiography of a young man who is an ex-priest, will therefore undoubtedly be taken up, with either horrified delight or sympathy, by all those who doubt, by those who wish, and by those who are certain, that priests can be """"all they are cracked up to be."""" The sensation-seekers, however, will be disappointed, for the book is a relatively mild, sometimes amusing, often moving, and always sincere, narrative of Gabriel Longo's experiences in the seminary, in the rectory, and, finally, in the world. Longo's misfortune apparently was that he was, in the words of Cardinal Bea, """"one of those who is called to the priesthood, but not to the celibate state,"""" and his story is one of mighty striving against, and final surrender to, perfectly natural inclinations. Spoiled Priest is not a renegade's book in the traditional sense; it is not anti-Church, anti-priesthood, or anti-chastity. It is rather a testimony to the agony of having to choose between personal honor and public disgrace, or personal dishonor and public approbation and reverence. Though the book obviously is intended for a mature audience, there is nothing in it to offend the sensibilities of the intelligent reader of any religious persuasion.

Farrell's renowned trilogy of the youth, early manhood, and death of Studs Lonigan: Young Lonigan, The Young Manhood of Studs Lonigan, and Judgment Day. In this relentlessly naturalistic portrait, Studs starts out his life full of vigor and ambition, qualities that are crushed by the Chicago youth's limited social and economic environment. Studs's swaggering and vicious comrades, his narrow family, and his educational and religious background lead him to a life of futile dissipation.

John Chamberlain provides an illuminating introductory essay to Farrell's masterpiece, one of the greatest novels of American literature.

  
An unparalleled example of American naturalism, the Studs Lonigan trilogy follows the hopes and dissipations of its remarkable main charactera would-be ""tough guy"" and archetypal adolescent, born to Irish-American parents on Chicagos South Sidethrough the turbulent years of World War I, the Roaring Twenties, and the Great Depression. The three novelsYoung Lonigan, The Young Manhood of Studs Lonigan, and Judgment Dayoffer a vivid sense of the textures of real life: of the institutions of Catholicism, the poolroom and the dance marathon, romance and marriage, gangsterism and ethnic rivalry, and the slang of the street corner. Cited as an inspiration by writers as diverse as Kurt Vonnegut and Frank McCourt, Studs Lonigan stands as a masterpiece of social realism in the ranks of John Steinbecks The Grapes of Wrath and Theodore Dreisers An American Tragedy.

Filled with practical information for those first days of sober living, this little book: offers newcomers advice about the program, how long it takes, and what to look for in a sponsor provides in-depth discussions of each of the Twelve Steps and related character defects poses common questions about AA and helping others, identifying where to find answers in the Big Book: Ed Webster wrote The Little Red Book, which had a chapter explaining how to work each of the twelve steps. Dr. Bob thought it was the best description of how to work the steps that had ever been written. He sent copies of it all over the U.S. and Canada with his recommendation. Until Dr. Bob's death in 1950, he insisted that the New York A.A. office make copies of this book available for sale through their office. He established that the one with the distinctively red cover has to be the earlier of the two 1947 printings. It says that it came out in January 1947. The other 1947 printing, which has a dull maroon cover, must have appeared later in that year. This later printing embodies a number of textual changes which were carried over to the fourth and fifth printings. It says that the 1949 edition should be taken as a kind of benchmark version for many purposes, since this was the last edition where Dr. Bob had had any input into the book. And we should remember that changes made in The Little Red Book after Ed Webster's death on June 3, 1971, which are numerous, were done by editors at the Hazelden Foundation In addition to copies of Ed Webster's other two well-known works.....Stools and Bottles, which first came out in 1955, and Our Devilish Alcoholic Personalities, which Ed published in 1970, the year before his death."

A timid, reluctant rabbit is dragged off to day care by his parents, is frightened by the teachers and the other kids, and is in misery for several days until a new teacher arrives. Then all is well-until he is told that he's going to have a little brother or sister and won't have to go to day care-and then he's not sure how he feels. Edvall has written a condescending tale that will add to children's fears. The text is choppy, and the characters are unnamed. The resolution will be no comfort to children whose lives are not changed by the arrival of a pretty new teacher. The illustrations are dark and gray, and the rabbits have no expressions on their faces. The pictures are small, and the pages are dominated by the text. Rosemary Wells's Edward Unready for School (Dial, 1995), Amy Schwartz's Annabelle Swift, Kindergartner (Orchard, 1991), and Martha Alexander's I'll Protect You from the Jungle Beasts (Dial, 1973; o.p.) address fear and new situations in a way that speaks to children.,<i>Sarah O'Neal, Salt Lake County Library System, UT</i>,Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.,,Ages 2-5. Little rabbit hates the idea of day care; he'd rather ""sleep all morning and play all afternoon."" But because his parents work, rabbit has to go, and once he arrives, he's miserable. There's plenty to do, but the teachers and other rabbit students make him nervous, and he longs for his parents. A gentle new teacher helps him make the adjustment, though, and when Rabbit's parents reveal that soon he won't need to go to day care anymore (a new baby's on the way), he's not sure whether he's ""sad or glad."" Cozy pencil-and-paint artwork filled with realistic, everyday details echo the warmth and reassurance in the text. Many kids will also recognize Rabbit's contemporary parents, who work and share responsibilities equally. Young ones hungry for more depictions of day care will also enjoy Robin Ballard's <i>My Day, Your Day </i>[BKL Ja 1 &amp; 15 01], which juxtaposes the daily activities of day-care students and their parents. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br /><i>Copyright  American Library Association.

This is the question that Karen Armstrong, the erudite former nun, asks in <i>Fields of Blood: Religion and the History of Violence</i>. Her answer is noor more specifically, that religion is not itself a source of violence and the problem lies more deeply in our human nature and the nature of the state. To prove her point, she covers roughly five thousand years of religious history, from Gilgamesh to the present day. Along the way, she builds the case against those who state, often without much context, that religion has been the cause of all the major wars in history. This is both an apologia and a wide-ranging and very readable lesson in the history of religion. It may not completely change the mind of everyone who reads it; but like everything Armstrong writes, it will leave them more enriched. <i>Chris Schluep</i>,&ldquo;Impressive . . . Particularly valuable is the book&rsquo;s long historical span, which allows the reader to trace not just the early history of warrior faith in such societies but also its evolution in modern times . . . That long historical reach allows Armstrong to argue very convincingly against some modern clich&eacute;s about religious violence . . .&#160; <i>Fields of Blood</i> has a terrific amount to offer virtually any reader.&rdquo;<br> --Philip Jenkins, <i>The&#160;Christian Century</i><br><br>&ldquo;A vast overview of religious and world history, sketching the early evolution of all global faiths . . . Armstrong denounces authoritarian secularism with eloquent passion . . . [and] does a good job of explaining why people who are deeply invested in traditional beliefs and social systems feel threatened and inclined to fight back.&rdquo;<br> --<i>The Economist</i><br><br>&ldquo;Careful, fair, and true . . . Armstrong demonstrates again and again that the great spasms of cruelty and killing through history have had little or no religious overlay . . . [and that] an overemphasis on religion&rsquo;s damage can blind people to the nonholy terrors that their states inflict . . . Apart from its larger argument, the book is packed with little insights and discoveries . . . The page-by-page detail of the book is much of the reason to read it . . . I generally end up judging books in two ways: by whether I can remember them and whether they change the way I think about the world. It&rsquo;s too soon to know about the first test, but on the basis of the second I recommend &lsquo;Fields of Blood.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br> --James Fallows, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br> &#160;<br> &#160;&ldquo;A valuable, readable rebuttal of a pernicious contemporary myth. The problem is not that religion corrupts human nature, but that human greed too often corrupts religion . . . Armstrong goes through the centuries and assorted cultures to demonstrate again and again how religious principles and religious leaders were co-opted to support warfare.&rdquo;<br> --Sarah Bryan Miller, <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i><br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;A convincing case that the relationship of religion to violence is complicated and ambivalent.&rdquo;<br> --Molly Farneth, <i>Commonweal</i><br><br>&ldquo;In a lucid and fleet prose . . . Armstrong argues that religion has been made a scapegoat for wars and violence . . . [She is] one of the keenest minds working on understanding the role religion plays in cultures around the globe.&rdquo;<br>&ndash;Graydon Royce, <i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i><br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Armstrong comes out swinging . . . [Her] prose is crisp and lucid, her command of fact encyclopedic, and her insights often brilliant.&rdquo;<br>&ndash;David Laskin, <i>The Seattle Times</i><br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;So important . . . [<i>Fields of Blood</i>] has been widely acclaimed for its scholarship, and deservedly so.&rdquo;<br>&ndash;Maureen Fiedler, <i>National Catholic Reporter</i><br> &#160;<br> &#160;&ldquo;Thought-provoking . . . a tour-de-force of the history of the world&rsquo;s major religions.&rdquo;<br>&ndash;Rebecca Denova, <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i><br><br>&ldquo;[A] bold new book . . . Armstrong makes a powerful case that critics like Dawkins ignore the lessons of the past and present in favor of a &lsquo;dangerous oversimplification&rsquo; . . . [Her argument] is strong enough to change minds.&rdquo;<br>&ndash;Randy Dotinga, <i>The</i> <i>Christian Science Monitor</i><br><br>&ldquo;With exquisite timing, religious historian Karen Armstrong steps forth with <i>Fields of Blood</i> . . . Laden with example . . . [Armstrong&rsquo;s] overall objective is to call a time-out. Think before you leap to prejudice, she says . . . Among the most interesting stuff in [her] book is her deconstruction of the modern Islamic stereotype . . . In the end, the point Armstrong feels most adamant about is that by blaming religion for violence, we are deliberately and disastrously blinding ourselves to the real, animating issues in the Middle East and Africa.&rdquo;<br>&ndash;Patricia Pearson, <i>The Daily Beast</i><br><br>&ldquo;Elegant and powerful . . . Both erudite and accurate, dazzling in its breadth of knowledge and historical detail . . . [Armstrong] seeks to demonstrate that, rather than putting the blame on the bloody images and legends in sacred texts and holy history, we should focus on the political contexts that frame religion.&rdquo;<br>&ndash;Mark Juergensmeyer, <i>The Washington Post</i> <br><br>&ldquo;A timely work . . . This passionately argued book is certain to provoke heated debate against the background of the Isis atrocities and many other acts of violence perpetrated around the world today in the name of religion.&rdquo;<br> &ndash;John Cornwell, <i>Financial Times</i><br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Detailed and often riveting . . . a mighty offering . . . Armstrong can be relied on to have done her homework and she has the anthropologist&rsquo;s respect for the &lsquo;otherness&rsquo; of other cultures . . . [Her] oeuvre is extensive, bringing a rare mix of cool-headed scholarship and impassioned concern for humanity to bear on the vexed topic of religion . . . [And she] is nothing if not democratic in her exposition.&rdquo;<br> &ndash;Salley Vickers, <i>The Guardian</i> (UK)<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Eloquent and empathetic, which is rare, and impartial, which is rarer . . . [Armstrong] ranges across the great empires and leading faiths of the world. Fields of Blood is never less than absorbing and most of the time as convincing as it is lucid and robust . . . [This] wonderful book certainly cleanses the mind. It may even do a little repair work on the heart.&rdquo;<br> &ndash;Ferdinand Mount, <i>The Spectator</i> (UK)<br><br>&ldquo;Characteristically eloquent and instructive . . . Armstrong&rsquo;s survey of four millennia of organized violence with religious overtones . . . aspires to put historical flesh on the bare bones of [the facts] . . . Modern society &ldquo;has made a scapegoat of faith&rdquo;, thereby obscuring and thus partly exonerating the far more massive crimes of modern secular states and armies, while also defaming the majority of religious believers who work for tolerance, justice and peace by nonviolent means . . . We are all awash in &ldquo;fields of blood&rdquo;. [This] engaging new book makes that case eloquently.&rdquo;<br> &ndash;Scott Appleby, <i>The Tablet </i>(UK)<br><br>&ldquo;From Gilgamesh to bin Laden, [Armstrong covers] almost five millennia of human experience . . . Supplying the context of what may look like religiously motivated episodes of violence, in order to show that religion as such was not the prime cause . . . She is no doubt right to say that the aggression of a modern jihadist does not represent some timeless essence of religion, and that other political, economic and cultural factors loom large in the stories of how and why individuals become radicalized.&rdquo;<br> &ndash;Noel Malcolm, <i>The Telegraph</i> (UK) <br><br>&ldquo;Fluent and elegant, never quite long enough . . . as much about the nature of warfare as it is about faith . . . [Armstrong] is taking issue with a clich&eacute;, the routine claim that religion, advertising itself as humanity&rsquo;s finest expression, has been responsible for most of the woes of the species . . . The Crusades, the Inquisition, the Wars of Religion, even modern &ldquo;jihadi&rdquo; terrorism: each is investigated . . . The picture is bleak, but certainly accurate . . . Exploitation and oppression continue . . . but these provide a challenge for the godly and the godless alike. The proposition, like the book, is noble.&rdquo;<br> &ndash;Ian Bell, <i>The Sunday Herald</i> (Scotland) <br><br>&ldquo;A well-written historical summary of what have traditionally been viewed as &ldquo;religious&rdquo; wars, showing convincingly that in pretty much all cases it was not so much religion as it was political issues that fueled the conflict.&rdquo;<br> &ndash;Augustine J. Curley, <i>Library Journal</i> (starred review)<br><br>&#160;&ldquo;Provocative and supremely readable . . . the comparative nature of [Armstrong&rsquo;s] inquiry is refreshing . . . Bracing as ever, [she] sweeps through religious history around the globe and over 4,000 years to explain the yoking of religion and violence and to elucidate the ways in which religion has also been used to counter violence.&rdquo;<br> &ndash;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<br><br>&ldquo;Epic in scale . . . a comprehensive and erudite study of the history of violence in relation to religion . . . Armstrong leads readers patiently through history . . . her writing is clear and descriptive, her approach balanced and scholarly . . . An intriguing read, useful resource and definitive voice in defense of the divine in human culture.&rdquo;<br> &ndash;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (starred review)<br><br>&ldquo;Armstrong again impresses with the breadth of her knowledge and the skill with which she conveys it to us.&rdquo;<br> &ndash;Ray Olson, <i>Booklist</i> (starred review)"

He taught mankind the way, the truth, and the life. He brought health to the sick, wisdom to the ignorant, and happiness to those in misery.
The teachings of this great Saint have been handed down through the ages in the Bible. However. the Bible was not written by Christ himself, nor were notes taken at the time that he spoke. These valuable teachings were passed from mouth to ear, and that portion that was remembered was recorded many years after his crucifixion. The teachings have gone through many translations and have been rewritten many times, often misunderstood and wrongly explained. They have even undergone mutilations and deformations. But they have, nevertheless. conquered more than half the world.
Christ generally gave his teachings in the form of parables. Only another perfect Master can understand the mystic significance of these parables and explain them clearly and concisely in a manner appropriate to contemporary life. While the teachings are not new-- for Truth always remains the same-- they have been so covered by dogma, ritual, and ceremony that their essence has been lost and forgotten.
People from all over the world had been asking Mahaharaj Charan Singh to explain the spiritual significance of many portions of the Bible. His illuminating discussions on Saint John, which comprise this book were originally given in discourses in India and America, and were enlarged upon by the author himself in 1985. Light on Saint John gives new and deeper understanding of the living Truth expressed in the Gospel. Anyone genuinely seeking Truth will find these pages rewarding and enlightening.
Although Saints may be separated physically from each other by time and space, they are a witness to one and the same Spirit. It is the same Truth that they proclaim. They show the way leading to the Supreme Father himself."

The text is from the works of John Muir, a naturalist whose writing reveals the excitement and beauty and strength in a world untouched by man. The photographs were created by Ansel Adams, whose camera discovers that which lies before us all - and magically, what our eyes may fail to communicate to our hearts. This combination of word and image creates a statement of greater intensity than either word or image alone. A truly inspiring combination of the writings of the naturalist Muir, with the photographs of the landscape photographer Adams, both giants in their respective fields, and true trailblazers. Sixty-four photographs are beautifully reproduced in the book. Adams has chosen phrases from Muir which, facing the photographs, are perfect captions. These photographs are the product of years of work, and almost all are here reproduced for the first time. Yosemite was preserved by being made a National Park, largely due to the young Muir's efforts. Adam's iconic nature photographs have helped save countless acres of wilderness in the US. This was a stirring and important publication on its release in 1948, and remains so today."

Around them, 1, 523 men, women, and children drowned or froze to death before rescue could arrive. Despite the subsequent losses of many thousands of lives in various 20th century transportation accidents on land, in the air, or at sea, no disaster in history is so readily conjured up by the mention of a single word as the dramatic loss of the unsinkable Titanic on the night of 14-15 April, 1912.

The Olympic class ships (as they were known), were the largest and most luxurious liners ever built, their sheer size giving an overwhelming feeling of safety and security. This was backed by the knowledge that they incorporated the best traditions of British shipbuilding and the latest techniques of design and construction. This story starts long before that fateful night however, in the hearts and minds of men who wanted to build the very biggest and the very best ships in the world. This book is a comprehensive guide to how and why these three fine sisters  Olympic, Titanic and Britannic  came to be built and the effect they were to have upon the world in the early stages of the 20th century.

Appendices of this fully illustrated, coffee table-style book include films, chronology, crew list, passenger list, cargo manifest, bibliography and index sections."

It mentions Rabbinic Hebrew (calling it NH  ""New Hebrew"") only occasionally and has no information about Modern Israeli Hebrew, which was in its early formative stages when this edition was published. Also, its style of linguistic description is somewhat archaic. For example, it uses many Latin terms for which modern English terms exist. It also tends to describe historical sound change as ""corruption"", something which is avoided in modern Linguistics. Despite these minor shortcomings, even in the 21st century Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar remains one of the most important scientific sources on the grammar of Hebrew. ~ From Wikisource"

All that huffing and puffing--could one wolf really be so unequivocally evil? Finally, we get to hear the rest of the story, &quot;as told to author Jon Scieszka,&quot; straight from the wolf's mouth. As Alexander T. Wolf explains it, the whole Big Bad Wolf thing was just a big misunderstanding. Al Wolf was minding his own business, making his granny a cake, when he realized he was out of a key ingredient. He innocently went from house to house to house (one made of straw, one of sticks, and one of bricks) asking to borrow a cup of sugar. Could he help it if he had a bad cold, causing him to sneeze gigantic, gale-force sneezes? Could he help it if pigs these days use shabby construction materials? And after the pigs had been ever-so-accidentally killed, well, who can blame him for having a snack?,As with <I><A href=""/exec/obidos/ISBN=067084487X/${0}"">The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales</A></I>, (another stellar collaboration by Scieszka and illustrator Lane Smith), children who know all the old stories by heart will delight in reading impudent new versions. Here, Scieszka's text is clever, savvy, and tabloid-quick, and Smith's stretchy-strange illustrations complete this funny, irreverent, thoroughly original tale. <I>(Ages 4 to 8)</I>,In this gaily newfangled version of a classic tale, Scieszka and Smith ( Flying Jake ) argue in favor of the villain, transforming the story of the three little pigs into a playfully suspicious, rather arch account of innocence beleaguered. Quoth the wolf: ""I don't know how this whole Big Bad Wolf thing got started, but it's all wrong."" According to his first-person testimony, the wolf went visiting the pigs in search of a neighborly cup of sugar; he implies that had the first two happened to build more durable homes and the third kept a civil tongue in his head, the wolf's helpless sneezes wouldn't have toppled them. As for his casual consumption of the pigs, the wolf defends it breezily (""It seemed like a shame to leave a perfectly good ham dinner lying there in the straw"") and claims cops and reporters ""framed"" him. Smith's highly imaginative watercolors eschew realism, further updating the tale, though some may find their urbane stylization and intentionally static quality mystifyingly adult. Designed with uncommon flair, this alternative fable is both fetching and glib. Ages 3-8. <BR>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc."

It may prove to be more popular than St. John's wort for the treatment of depression and other serotonin-related conditions, as it's been shown to produce results in as little as two weeks, while the herb may take a month or longer.,Author Michael Murray, N.D., a leading naturopath and coauthor of <a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761511571/${0}""><I>The Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine</I></a>, delves very deeply to explain the hows and whys of depression at the neurotransmitter level, and the illustrations of presynaptic membranes may be a bit much for the lay reader. There are also several sections with intimidating titles along the lines of &quot;Enhancing 5-HTP with Catecholamine Precursors.&quot; But the book's comprehensiveness makes up for its occasional denseness. Murray includes enlightening sections on nutrition for peak serotonin synthesis, other complementary herbal supplements, and many online and physical sources for obtaining 5-HTP. <I>--Erica Jorgensen</I>,Murray (Encyclopedia of Nutritional Supplements, Prima, 1996) believes that the symptoms of depression, obesity, headaches, insomnia, anxiety, hyperactivity, premenstrual syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyalgia can be alleviated by taking the amino acid 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan). The body converts 5-HTP into serotonin, a neurotransmitter vital for brain function, and Murray argues that increased serotonin levels mitigate much of the discomfort associated with the conditions cited above. He devotes major chapters to depression, weight loss, insomnia, and headache, with each following the same format: exploration of the condition and orthodox treatment, review of studies using 5-HTP, and recommendations for therapeutic doses. Personal stories illustrate how patients have benefited from 5-HTP. It is apparent from warnings given throughout the book, however, that use of this natural supplement is not without danger, especially if taken with certain prescription medicines.

Ltd, in Pune for 6 months.From his childhood, being creative was his passion, but his first priority was building a career, which was also the dream of his family. He had to give up his dreams of creativity to concentrate on his studies. After clearing his CA in July 2011, he was able to move from his studies to fulfil his dreams of creative pursuits.He had been writing since childhood, but just raw lines, that nobody read, and though they were special to him, he did not take them too seriously. At 17 years, he started writing short shaayeris (poems), that were appreciated by family and friends, who encouraged him to write more. In his teenage years, he had always dreamt of a fairy tale life, but soon realized that life is in fact a scary journey, where you don t know what will happen next! Today, having experienced life and being wiser, he took on the task of writing his debut book, which he started in October 2011.His inspiration for the book is the confusion that teenagers of today face in their definition and understanding of what is love. Teenagers feel that falling in love is just by talking, joking, and meeting friends. Sad, but this fact is not true, all the time! On the other hand, sometimes, they think that their love is just good friendship. Most youngsters today are confused between love, friendship, and infatuation and those who get true love don t even know how to appreciate it ... Ironical but true! Through this book, he wants people to understand the difference between friendship, infatuation, and true love, to have faith in their love and wait for their time to come. Love is also about sacrifices and is in the hand of destiny. Love and destiny are co-related ... if there is love in your stars; it will come with time. He would like to use his books to address some critical issues and try to remove them from society. You can contact him at his official page on Facebook named ME N HER - A Strange Feeling.

It seems Backman, in his power broker heyday, may have obtained secrets that compromise the worlds most sophisticated satellite surveillance system.

Backman is quietly smuggled out of the country in a military cargo plane, given a new name, a new identity, and a new home in Italy.

[The Golden Door Cooks Light &amp; Easy] offers fresh, lively tastes... (<i>Boston Globe</i> ),""Bringing out the seasonal freshness in ingredients, without using butters and other unnecessary richness, is the cornerstone,"" says Michel Stroot, who has helped make the Golden Door's ""spa cuisine"" recipes so popular with guests for three decades. In The Golden Door Cooks Light and Easy, he really brings his concepts home, providing nutritionally sound recipes that are flamboyant, aromatic, delicious and serenely pleasing to the eye-yet are also easy to make. This cookbook is written ""to provide the time-pressed person with a cuisine of simple and enticing dishes that will renew physical and mental energy."" You'll also find yourself going to the market with a new sense of excitement and possibility, searching out ingredients from local farmers and suppliers (or your own garden) that fairly burst with ripeness and flavor. It is geared to every sort of home chef, from those who wish to get back to the basics, to working and/or single parents, to food aficionados who love interesting spices and farmers' market adventures, to those with physical or dietary challenges. Inspired by his years of working only steps from a huge organic garden at the spa, Chef Stroot shares his secrets for creating dishes that not only celebrate seasonal freshness but also are elegant and simple. Remarkably unfussy, this chef is unafraid to let flavors come out naturally through simple techniques like steaming, sauting in non-stick pans with very little oil, and grilling. Shopping wisely, cutting time in the kitchen, and reducing fat while still enhancing flavor are just some of Chef Stroot's well-founded advice. You'll feel like a guest at the famous spa as you sample from chapters covering appetizers to desserts, poultry and seafood to meatless main courses, and Chef Stroot's favorite menus. An introduction takes you inside the Golden Door, where ""luxury"" is imparted as much by beautiful surroundings, calm reflection, and joyful activities (like hiking, yoga, and t'ai chi) as by artful service. The recipes here remind us that we all can eat well every day, enjoying meals that are both healthful and beautiful. Here are the recipes that guests love most-foods full of energy and Chef Michel's own enthusiasm for life.,,"

In word and deed they served as role models for their contemporaries, and they continue to inspire us today. Their words of wisdom embody classic elements of Jewish culture and faith. Basic to the custom of pilgrimage to these locations is the belief that prayer at holy sites has special meaning. The faithful hold that righteous buried at these sites will act as advocates before g-d, enabling our prayers for health, succes in marriage, and comfortable livelihood to be heard sympathetically. The graves of our ancestors are a source of rich, historical meaning for us, their descendants, connecting us to the Land and to our roots.

On the one hand, he is considered the 'spiritual father of pakistan'. On the other, his message of eastern revivalism places him in the ranks of the twentieth century's major intellectuals. Iqbal's tragedy was that after his death, he was made the national poet of pakistan and largely ignored in india. In his time, he was lauded as much as tagore but today india celebrates tagore while iqbal has been banished from her consciousness. This meticulously researched biography will redress that erasure. This is the story of iqbal's evolution as a poet, philosopher and politician. While his role in the struggle for india's freedom and the pakistan movement are well known, not much is known about his personal life. This book highlights some of the least known facets of the poet's life: how did a nationalist poet transform into a poet of islamic revivalism and global revolution? how did three years in europe change iqbal's political and philosophical outlook? why did he start writing in persian during his stay in europe? why did his first marriage fail and how did his romantic relationships affect him? what exactly was the poet's role in bringing about partition? written with the passion of an ardent devotee, zafar anjum's iqbal answers all of these questions - and many more - in this carefully told biography."

Evans explains ancient biblical prophecies about current events that affect America's role and destiny in the twenty-first century. 'Why do they hate us?' That's the anguished cry of Amer-icans who still seek an explanation for the terrorist attacks on the United States two years ago and the continued political violence against U.S. soldiers, diplomats, tourists, and missionaries. Today, Americans live in constant fear of the next major act of domestic terrorism-but instead of gaining international sympathy, the U.S. finds allied support more tepid than ever. Now, Michael D. Evans sheds light on political events from a prophetic perspective in a thought- provoking look at the biblical prophecies written more than 2,000 years ago that predicted these current hostilities. America is targeted, he says, because of its friendship with Israel, its foundation on Judeo-Christian principles, and its basis in democracy. He also warns that the attacks will continue and that Scripture predicts a demise for the United States if it compromises its allegiance to Israel and its constitution's moral foundations."

Usage notes appear at the beginning of entries for extremely offensive terms -- so they are impossible to miss. Nuances of uses are clearly explained, as is the reclaiming of some terms by certain groups.,In addition to the revised entries, the book also includes an essay, ""Avoiding Insensitive and Offensive Language,"" an invaluable tool for today's home, school, and workplace.,Endorsements for Random House Webster's College Dictionary, 1999 edition:,""We recommend the new edition of Random House Webster's College Dictionary.

There is a great variety of point types in the United States, due to cultural diversity and at least 14,000 years of expert flint knapping. Over those years points developed imperceptively from one type to another to meet new hafting or hunting requirements. Because projectile points have many variations and distinctive forms, they can be easily identified by students of point typology. The descriptions and drawings in this book present important data necessary to identify each type. Specimens were selected for illustrations that would best represent the specific point type in various stages of use. The original descriptions often were determined from only a few specimens, sometimes only from a single source, so consequently neither the total range in size and quality nor all varieties of the type may be defined."

Krishnamurti, one of the great thinkers of our time, addresses himself particularly to young people and discusses the essentials of right education. In a beautiful simplicity of language, he probes the roots of fear and seeks to eradicate deeply entrenched habits of imitation. The life he would have young people lead is an about-turn, difficult for the adult mind to comprehend. Its honest simplicity and freedom require the removal of barriers of prejudice that have shut out from our hearts and minds the possibility of unadulterated truth. He says: There is a revolution which is entirely different and which must take place if we are to emerge from the endless series of anxieties, conicts and frustrations in which we are caught. This revolution has to begin, not with theory and ideation, which eventually prove worthless, but with a radical transformation in the mind itself. Such a transformation can be brought about only through right education and the total development of the human being. ... J. Krishnamurti was born in South India and educated in England. Hailed by many from early youth as a spiritual teacher, he rejected adulation and leadership in order to encourage spiritual freedom and the discovery of understanding by each one for himself. He has devoted his life to speaking and counseling, traveling in the U.S.A., Europe, India and other countries of the world, addressing thousands of people, always pointing the way for each man to nd himself."

The narratives are presented in a series of themes, ranging from crossing the Atlantic to an inside look at the Unites States. Although few regretted the decision to emigrate, nearly all suffered pangs of homesickness, and many attempted to imbue their children with a sense of ""Danishness"". these Danes of the past come alive as they describe both successes and failures in their own words.

Located in downtown Brooklyn, this home away from home has been wooing New Yorkers since it first opened its doors on Election Day, 1950. Three generations of the Rosen family have served up not only cheesecakes, but also a wealth of other diner delicacies, from Brisket Melt to out-of-this-world ice-cream sodas. Written by the sons of founder Harry Rosen, <I>Welcome to Junior's</I> combines slices of Brooklyn's history and culture with fascinating stories, and, thankfully for us, more than 100 recipes, including 7 for cheesecake. Of course, the <I>real</I> cheesecake recipes are a closely guarded secret, but the Rosens share a similar blueprint with us that ensures ""you'll soon be experiencing the taste of ecstasy."" There are no soggy graham-cracker bases here--just a lovely layer of light sponge-cake, which can be prepared in the home kitchen in five simple steps. Then, a bounty of cheesecake toppings are yours, including fresh blueberries, juicy pineapple, decadent chocolate swirl, and even pumpkin. Lest we forget what else Junior's has to offer, the Rosens share recipes for, among others, Baked Meat Loaf with Mushroom Sauce, French Fried Onion Rings, even Matzoh Ball Soup.,Junior's is much more than a diner; it is an experience, an urban retreat where good old-fashioned service still exists, where fantastic food is a guarantee, and where regulars and newcomers are all welcome. If you can't make it there in person, let <I>Welcome to Junior's</I> transport you there with words. <I>--Naomi Gesinger</I>,Since it opened its door on Election Day 1950, Junior's has been a Brooklyn landmark: a place where politicians and performers eat comfortably alongside teachers and taxi drivers. In this book of New York diner recipes, founder Harry Rosen's sons, Marvin and Walter, team up with author Allen to provide a chatty cookbook/cultural history of the business and its neighborhood. In chapters arranged by decade, from the 1930s to the 1990s, the book maps how the 1929 Enduro Sandwich Shop, which catered to vaudeville and moviegoers during the Depression and to the Brooklyn Navy Yard's 70,000 workers during WWII, evolved into the family-style restaurant that sells about 7000 of its famous cheesecakes a week. Today, Junior's menu reflects the cultural diversity of Brooklyn. From the 1930s are recipes for the standard Matzoh Ball Soup and Chocolate Egg Cream. In the 1950s, the restaurant introduced Old-Fashioned French Toast, made with Challah bread soaked in eggs and sugar for 15 minutes. The 1960s was marked by such selections as the rich Homemade Chili and Big Meatballs with Spaghetti. The desserts stand out; highlights include recipes for Junior's famous, Jewish-style cheesecakes (of the eight included, Junior's Famous No. 1 Pure Cream Cheesecake stands out). Home cooks looking to bring Brooklyn comfort food to the table will enjoy taking this nostalgic tourAand the book's handsome packaging, featuring b&w photos and orange lettering and highlights that reflect Junior's famed orange booths, adds to the pleasure. <BR>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc."

The plot, gossamer itself, stretches an azure web across Kastner's brilliant observed descriptions of pre-war Salzburg's baroque confection of cathedrals and homes, up and down dale streets, and blessed denizens. Few travel book have better captured the special sense of place that is Salzburg. Written in part as a sly rebuff to the ugly German political machinations of 1937 you might have heard of, A Salzburg Comedy recalls Ninotchka's famous admonition for just 'a few more moments' as the curtains across Europe are being pulled down not for lovers trysts, but because of air raid blackouts.

DeStefano, author of <I>A Travel Guide to Heaven</I>, offers readers a refreshing look at this evergreen topic by focusing on 10 prayers God ""always"" answers. ""Why don't people take advantage of prayers that work? One big reason is that they are so caught up in prayers that <I>don't</I> always work,"" says DeStefano. He offers readers this guarantee: ""before you even get to the last page of this book, your life will begin to change before your eyes."" Prayers include ""God, show me that you exist,"" ""God, forgive me,"" ""God, give me courage"" and ""God, lead me to my destiny."" DeStefano uses the Christian Bible as the foundation for his work, not offering quick fixes but instead expounding on the need for true repentance, right motives and genuine commitment. More conservative camps will most likely cluck at what they see as DeStefano's lack of firmness about salvation as a prerequisite to both heard and answered prayer, but a careful reading shows that the author understands faith, not selfishness, is the foundation for these prayers.

How do we get the divine &#8216;Yes&#8217;? In a simple, straightforward style, Anthony DeStefano takes on the mysteries of prayer. He casts a wide net to appeal to all Christians everywhere without compromising the gospel one iota. The title alone, <i><b>Ten Prayers God Always Says Yes To</b></i>, will attract even people who aren&#8217;t believers but who cry out for help in the night. For them, the first prayer: &#8216;God, show me that you exist&#8217; can be a life-changer. But don&#8217;t stop there. Read it all. It could revolutionize your prayer life.&#8221;<br><br>Pastor Jack Hayford<br>President, International Church of the Foursquare Gospel<br>Founding Pastor, The Church on the Way<br><br><br>&#8220;Polls tell us that most Americans believe in prayer.&#160; However, most admit they don't spend much time praying, nor do they think it is very productive.&#160; This remarkable book can make a difference for anyone who wants to pray with results. Anthony DeStefano shares insights on prayer that are practical, workable, and attainable.&#160; Everyone can profit from reading this book!&#8221;<br><br>Dr. Paul Cedar<br>Chairman, CEO, Mission America Coalition<br><br><br>&#8220;Do we really need another book on prayer? We certainly need this one! <i><b>Ten Prayers God Always Says Yes To</b></i> is remarkably different and refreshingly direct. It takes the reader straight to the heart of the issue of answered prayer and leaves him or her there wanting more&#8212;of God, of course. This book will go on my shelf beside the great classics on prayer.&#8221;<br><br>Dr. Dick Eastman<br>President, Every Home for Christ<br>President of America&#8217;s National Prayer Committee<br><br><br>&#8220;Anthony DeStefano has once again drawn his readers into the mystery of God&#8217;s love and invited us to reflect more deeply on our relationship with Him. In a simple yet profound way, <i><b>Ten Prayers God Always Says Yes To</b></i> offers insights, and indeed a practical wisdom, that will resonate with anyone who has ever struggled with personal prayer. I recommend this book to any and all who are searching for a fresh perspective on the meaning and value of a life of prayer, and, ultimately, for a more fulsome encounter with the Living God.&#8221;<br><br><br>Cardinal Renato Raffaele Martino<br>President, Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace<br>The Vatican"

Despite little experience, Mandel left Canada for Los Angeles to pursue stand-up comedy, where he eventually moved from the clubs to cable specials, an album, and numerous late-night talk show appearances, success he'd parlay into film roles and a 6-year stint on NBC hospital dramedy St. Elsewhere. Mandel soon developed what he calls ""Obsessive Prankster Disorder,"" a need to stage elaborate practical jokes, some quite amusing. Not all is fun and games, however; Mandel also describes how mental disorders and medical crises have impacted his career, and balances his triumphs with lengthy surveys of failed performances.

The Queen of Belgium and Yehudi Menuhin are some of his famous disciples. In 1991, he was presented with the Padma Shri and in 2002, the Padma Bhushan.

Nor has Nietzsche today the distinction of serving as the historical example of the critical reactionary.

As his characters struggle for survival, Michener weaves together the exciting high points of Alaskas story: its brutal origins; the American acquisition; the gold rush; the tremendous growth and exploitation of the salmon industry; the arduous construction of the Alcan Highway, undertaken to defend the territory during World War II. A spellbinding portrait of a human community fighting to establish its place in the world, Alaska traces a bold and majestic saga of the enduring spirit of a land and its people."

She longs for the Catholic Church of her youth, that ""dealt with issues at the core of the Gospelsuffering, injustice, sickness, and poverty"" rather than a Christianity influenced by a crop of preachers who seem to believe that ""Jesus healed the sick, fed the hungry and cared for the poor just so we don't have to."" Addressing a broad range of issues including women, the religious right (and left), the GOP and her own political party, the Democrats, Townsend hopes to appeal to a wide audience, not just a Christian one. Personal anecdotes, including the text of a note from her father, Robert Kennedy, written to her on the morning of her uncle John F. Kennedy's funeral, make this a very personal discussion of faith, religious history and politics. Unfortunately, this doesn't always translate into a cohesive discussion, and the workmanlike style coupled with an doe-eyed earnestness leave the reader wanting. Townsend's call for the disillusioned to stay in church, meet with the priest or minister and help the community comes off more as a catechism than a battle cry. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br />Copyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,Instead of emphasizing the fact that we are all children of God, faith in America now divides communities."" So charges Townsend, daughter of Robert Kennedy, who offers a faith-based platform for liberals.The right gets religion wrong, and the left doesn't get it at all, theologian Jim Wallis has observed. Townsend is proof to the contrary, a committed Catholic who despairs of the Church's political leanings and who counters with an ethic of service to the poor and powerless. In a neat but too-brief analysis, she contrasts her father's vision with that of Ronald Reagan, and by extension the liberal and conservative views of human nature. Asked by David Frost what people are put on earth for, RFK replied, ""If you've made some contribution to someone else, to improve their life, and make their life a little more livable, a little more happy, I think that's what you should be doing."" Reagan, by contrast, argued, ""Each man must find his own salvation . . . every man to be what God intended him to be."" Townsend dismisses the latter view as justification for ""an entire multimillion-dollar industry that treats God as little more than a self-help guru who helps you be all you can be,"" and the notion of compassionate conservatism as ""just another way to put the wolf in sheep's clothing."" There is an appropriate role for religion and the religious in politics, Townsend argues, one that reconciles the liberating vision of the Founding Fathers with values born of faith, such as those contained in Pope Leo XIII's encyclical Rerum Novarum; the public, she reckons, is ready for just such a hybrid, even as rightist clergy and politicians have insisted that it's a war of each against all out there, undermining ""the sense of national unity and collective responsibility that has mattered so much throughout American history.""Watch for elements of Townsend's well-framed argument at the 2008 Democratic Convention.

Kaspar a scholar, a lover, and a cryptic observer of everyone's petty obsessions, including his own is caught in the adventure of his life. For the first time in a long time, his lust for knowledge hits a fever pitch: he suspects he s about to unravel a mysterious money trail from the days of Nazi Germany. But he s not alone his boss, an old college classmate, has begun acting more tyrannical than usual, and the institute where Kaspar works suddenly becomes a cauldron of backstabbing and intrigue. Kaspar thinks he may be falling in love, but this, too, becomes a maze of double identities and twisted paths. Evil is never banal in Hedeen s brilliant exploration of the ways we become lost. But in the end, THE KNOWLEDE TREE shows the real triumph and quiet joy of a man making his way. Written with a beguilingly honest, haunting, and elegant prose, The Knowledge Tree gives us a tour of Berlin and of the human heart that lights both the dark corners and the familiar haunts.

But before I knew it, I&#8217;d been struck with a lightning bolt . . . and I was completely powerless to stop it.,This isn&#8217;t just my love story; it&#8217;s a universal tale of passion, romance, and all-encompassing love that sweeps us off our feet.,It&#8217;s the story of a cowboy. And Wranglers. And chaps. And the girl who fell in love with them."

Drawing from thousands of hours of previously unavailable (and still classified) tape-recorded meetings between the highest levels of the American military command in Vietnam, <i>A Better War</i> is an insightful, factual, and superbly documented history of these final years. Through his exclusive access to authoritative materials, award-winning historian Lewis Sorley highlights the dramatic differences in conception, conduct, and--at least for a time--results between the early and later years of the war. Among his most important findings is that while the war was being lost at the peace table and in the U.S. Congress, the soldiers were winning on the ground.

During a year spent studying medicinewhile attending an occasional English classhe learned that though a clumsy dissection of a frog resulted in much blood and a fail mark, a clumsy analysis of a poem (if reasonably well expressed) might be considered to show originality and be awarded an A. At the end of the year he changed to English and has not looked back. He now has post-graduate degrees from Oxford and London and a diploma in Linguistics from Cambridge. Following his retirement from Chichester University, a mild form of hypochondria and nightly access to the internet have enabled him to renew his interest in medicine. Claire Saunders chose an indoor rather than an outdoor life when, at the age of sixteen, she failed her Queen's Guide Award. On graduating from Oxford, she accepted a post lecturing in English at University College Dublin. After two years she realized that she much preferred teaching to research and moved to the English department at Oxford Girls High School. Marriage and two children followed but she was able to maintain her interest in teaching by becoming a tutor for the Open University and, later, to catch up on research by taking an MA at Sussex University. She was working on a PhD on Shakespeare's stage images when what she took to be symptoms of the menopause turned out to be a third pregnancy. She chose to terminate her PhD.

If I were to describe the book in one word, it would be - Impressive! The book tells you about the magical experiences of Swami Kripalvanandji (referred to in this book as Bapuji) and Lord Lakulish (referred to as Dadaji). There is a vivid description of what Kripalvanandji went through as he visits many places with Lord Lakulish: Bombay, Vrindavan, Mathura, etc. His plight as a young yoga student is very evident. As a 19-year-old going through various conditions, it must have been torturous! The book describes the emotions of the young Swami Kripalvanandji and how close he was to his guru, how the guru recognizes him as a future top rated Yogi and guides him through his conquest. The author describes how long it took Swami Kripalvanandji to get to an advanced yogi state. The author does say that it takes many lifetimes' work to be in a state of a higher yoga. The book also talks about various states of Yoga as his disciple Swami Rajarshi Muni goes through it. That gives a perspective to an uninitiated one about the path of Hath Yoga. The book also describes what the Divine Body is and how it is formed, although not in as much detail as the book Divine body through Yoga(Same author). The book is well written, especially considering that it was originally written in an Indian language and then translated to English. It is an easy read until you reach towards the end where there are letters exchanged between the guru and disciple (the author). Apart from that, it is very hard to put the book down! If you are looking for what Yoga is and how to do it, this is not the book. For that look for the excellent book, Classical Hath Yoga, a book well organized with tremendous wealth of information in it. As an aside, I visited the temple of Lord Lakulish at Kayavarohan when visiting India in December 2007 and it did allow me to visualize what the author describes about the temple construction. Both the temple and the idol are impressive. The Yoga Institute is located on the same grounds and does have favorable timings for Yoga. --G Man Yogi, Amazon.Com, October 20, 2008,SWAMI RAJARSHI MUNI Swami Rajarshi Muni was born in 1931 in the lineage of the Jadeja rulers of the former State of Kutchh in Gujarat, India. He briefly served in several Governmental roles before he renounced the world and received sannyas from his guru, Swami Kripalvanda. He has pursued the study and practice of Yoga since early youth, and has been engaged almost exclusively in secluded Yoga sadhana for at least ten hours a day since he received sannyas initiation in 1971. For many years Muniji has undertaken intense research in the Vedic Scriptures and the associated literature of ancient times. He is a Sanskrit scholar and a profound philosopher who has written many books, most of which are published in Gujarati, his native language. Until recently only a few of these works have been translated into English. Thus relatively few readers in the western world have had the opportunity to engage his extraordinary mind and appreciate the depth of his philosophical insight. More importantly, Muniji is a highly advanced yogi who for the past thirty-five years has successfully engaged in the most intense and demanding sadhana (spiritual practice). In this way, his vast practical experience in the pursuit of Divine Yoga matches his grasp of the fundamentals of the philosophy and science of Yoga. In 1993 he emerged from secluded sadhana in response to a spiritual calling to undertake certain works for the advancement of the public good. At this time he set out to propagate the moral, ethical and spiritual values of the sanatan dharma as well as the knowledge of true Yoga. These goals are central to the mission of the Lakulish spiritual lineage, of which he is currently the spiritual head. His efforts to accomplish these goals have led to the establishment of the Life Mission, a world-wide organization that serves as a vehicle to spread the knowledge and practice of both Yoga and the sanatan dharma. He has also created a major new pilgrimage center in western India. Finally, he has increased the vast library of his published works to nearly 100 titles in four different languages, including ten books in English. These unique works on Yoga and the spiritual and cultural heritage of India are unlike anything that has been seen in the modern world in that they are both supremely profound and eminently practical. His work in the world duly completed, he reverted to secluded sadhana once again in February 2007. Swami Rajarshi Muni is an advanced yogi, a realized Master in the classic mould of Indian adepts: a knower of the Kundalini and master of khechari mudra. He is a gift to the world from the eternal culture that since ancient times has shared the gentle light of Brahmavidya, the knowledge of God."

Binya comes across a blue Japanese umbrella, by which she is instantly fascinated enough to exchange it with her grandmother's precious necklace believed to bring luck. With the beautiful umbrella that no one else has but everyone wants, she sings and dances in a vast plain, which is the celebration of a fulfilled desire as well as a ritual to endow the fetishist value in the umbrella, a mere object. Thus, it is only natural that the village people treat differently the owner of the umbrella, which is equaled to power and ability. Based on the novel of the same title by Ruskin Bond, the film blends the extremely colorful and gaudy images with Bollywood-style song and dance, stressing the old lesson that materialist desires lead to punishment.,,"

Within these pages, the author investigates and answers many vital questions: Is it possible, even probable, that a major Bible prophecy, which has been largely overlooked by most Jewish and Gentile Bible believers, is about to be fulfillid in the immediate future? Does the prophet Zechariah predict the exact moment in the prophetic future when the Messiah will dramatically reveal Himself again to the entire population of Israel? Will the descendants of King David finally embrace their long-promised Messiah and declare Him to the world?,This intriguing book is an introduction to an amazing new possibility that is largely overlooked by authors writing about prophetic subjects. The Messiah Comes to Israel encourages a fresh approach to many Scriptures that predict glorious things for Israel - not in the distant future of the Millennium but in the very near future.,,Aminister for more than 50 years, Gerald Rowlands has written numerous books on the End Times. He has visited Israel more than 20 times and preached on numerous occassions at the Christian Celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles in Jerusalem. He has preached worldwide while living in Australia, Africa, and Southeast Asia. For 10 years he was the Director of Praise and Worship at the annual ICEJ Christian celebration of the Feast of Tanbernacles in Jerusalem. He and his wife, Elizabeth, have three daughterss, six grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.,,,"

It rethinks the sensationalized and romanticized version of Plato's Atlantis, with proof after proof of the identities and commercial enterprises of those ancient master mariners. It clearly shows that the story as told by Egyptian priests to Solon, who brought it back to Greece, was derived from original records contained in ancient Egyptian temple inscriptions and papyrus texts. The book further identifies the most reasonable location of the capital city of Atlantis, the correct time and extent of its oceanic empire, and the reason for its collapse in 1200 BCE. It is fully illustrated with laminated cover, Contents, Glossary, Endnotes, Bibliography, and Index."

In the past two decades, the landscape has shifted dramatically. Buddhist women have come out of the shadows and begun to take active roles, both in the spheres of religion and social transformation. The 1st Sakyadhita International Conference on Buddhist Women held in 1987 in Bodhgaya, India, gave rise to a revolutionary new awareness among Buddhist women that has led to major changes throughout the Buddhist world. Out of the Shadows: Socially Engaged Buddhist Women is a collection of essays that shed light on Buddhist women's past achievements. These essays recount women's struggles against tremendous odds, their earnest spiritual practice, and their diligent efforts to relieve the sufferings of the world. Beginning with the story of the Buddha's wife and spanning more than 2000 years of history, the essays illuminate the lives of Buddhist laywomen and nuns, from a diversity of cultures throughout, Asia and beyond. The richness and variety of their struggles and accomplishments are a valuable chapter in women's history and an inspiring legacy."

Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia written, compiled, edited and re-edited by ""ordinary people"" is the most ubiquitous example, and its history makes remarkable reading. But also considered are lesser-known success stories of global collaboration that star Procter &amp; Gamble, BMW, Lego and a host of software and niche companies. Problems arise when the authors indulge an outsized sense of scope-""this may be the birth of a new era, perhaps even a golden one, on par with the Italian renaissance, or the rise of Athenian democracy""-while acknowledging only reluctantly the caveats of weighty sources like Microsoft's Bill Gates. Methods for exploiting the power of collaborative production are outlined throughout, an alluring compendium of ways to throw open previously guarded intellectual property and to invite in previously unavailable ideas that hide within the populace at large. This clear and meticulously researched primer gives business leaders big leg up on mass collaboration possibilities; as such, it makes a fine next-step companion piece to James Surowiecki's 2004 bestseller The Wisdom of Crowds.<br />Copyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.,Anyone who has done even a modest amount of browsing on the Internet has probably run across Wikipedia, the user-edited online encyclopedia that now dwarfs the online version of Encyclopedia Britannica. This is the prime example of what is called the new Web, or Web 2.0, where sites such as MySpace, YouTube, Flickr, and even the Human Genome Project allow mass collaboration from participants in the online community. These open systems can produce faster and more powerful results than the traditional closed proprietary systems that have been the norm for private industry and educational institutions. Detractors claim that authentic voices are being overrun by ""an anonymous tide of mass mediocrity,"" and private industry laments that competition from the free goods and services created by the masses compete with proprietary marketplace offerings. The most obvious example of this is Linux, the open-source operating system that has killed Microsoft in the server environment. But is this a bad thing? Tapscott thinks not; and as a proponent of peering, sharing, and open-source thinking, he has presented a clear and exciting preview of how peer innovation will change everything. <i>David Siegfried</i><br /><i>Copyright  American Library Association.

She has written over 100 books that have been translated into 31 different languages, and over 10 million copies of her books have been sold worldwide. After graduating with an MBA from Harvard Business School, Lillian went on to pursue a highly successful business career in banking and finance in the 1980's in Hong Kong. Her business acumen, drive and abundant energy soon led her from the finance world to the world of luxury department stores and boutiques where, through a leveraged buy out, she became Chairman and shareholder of The Dragon Seed Group. All the while she was guided and taught by her feng shui masters in Hong Kong and China - and she attributes much of her monumental and quick rise to success in Hong Kong directly to them. Lillian soon decided to retire from active corporate life and return to Malaysia to raise her beautiful daughter, Jennifer, and spend more time with her family. It was at this time she began to devote her energy to writing and furthering her study of feng shui. She published her first book in Malaysia in1995 that quickly became a best seller and the rest is history. Today she is Chairman of Wofs.Com, a feng shui franchise and merchandising company run by her daughter, Jennifer Too. She trains feng shui students and future consultants at her Certified Consulting Institute in Malaysia and is much loved by her readers, associates and students for the way she teaches practical feng shui in a user-friendly way, using ordinary situations and circumstances that interest people and affect their everyday lives. In November 2009, at the International Feng Shui Convention in Singapore, the well-deserved title of GRAND MASTER OF FENG SHUI was conferred upon Lillian Too. Immediately following this accolade, in early January 2010, she received the prestigious Brand Laureate Personality of The Year Award presented by the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia! There seems to be no stopping her popularity and recognition these days! Lillian believes everyone should know her secrets and learn how to adapt feng shui to modern life.,,"

Boynton This is a novel which will affect the reader as deeply as the heroine does the men and women in the hook itself. It is the story of a modern woman of courage, a woman alone and desperately ill in a foreign land, who still has the inner strength to bring the healing quality of her spirit to others. No one who reads it can help but be moved by this picture of contemporary Christianity in action. The setting is an extraordinary fifteen-acre Chinese garden to which lane Brested has come in her hour of need. Here in the River Garden of Pure Repose with its gray-green peacefulness and fragile, fantastic buildings, Jane finds an island of peace in war-torn China. Accepting the reality of her suffering, she holds her spirit apart and insists that others treat her with this distinction in mind. Many people visit Jane in the River Garden, attracted by the rare qualities of heart and mind which she possesses. There is a young pilot who has lost his faith and will to live; a proud, old style Chinese scholar on the verge of starvation; a young Communist girl, in desperate need of help, who hates all that Christianity stands for; and a young and lovely member of the OSS who fears love but finds it in the Garden. To each of these Jane Brested brings her strength, her serenity, and her help. Events take place in the River Garden that concern more than Jane. Birth, death, war, treachery, and love enter its walls. Yet as the action flows to its climax, Jane is the focus. On each event that occurs, on each person whom she sees, her personality has a strong and lasting impact. Nor is the River Garden itself less memorable by interweaving into her story the legends which lie behind the garden's temples and buildings., the author gives a remarkable portrayal of the way of life and quiet devotion to beauty to which the culture and tradition of ancient China was dedicated."

After the war, the Communist regime considered him a traitor of the Polish People. He was murdered in the prison of the Ministry of Public Security of Poland in Warsaw. Pilecki's story is centered around his interrogation in the dungeons of the state secret police. The comic presents the details of Pilecki's arrival in Auschwitz, his escape, and plans considered by the AK to attack the camp to free prisoners. This illustrated history book shows the complicated relationship between prisoners, the functionary prisoners (Kapos), and the members of the SS guard garrison within Auschwitz in a new and non-stereotypical way, showing the human side of the this tragedy. This book in particular also delves partly into Poland's post-WWII history. Episodes from Auschwitz is a series of comic book-format illustrated history books, fully endorsed by the Directors of the Auschwitz Birkenau State Museum and former prisoners, that focus on the individual people that lived through or were murdered at the Auschwitz Death Camps - where out of the 1.3 million deported there, 1.1 million were murdered. Each book in the series includes: an introduction that details what was happening during WWII while the events in the Episode took place, illustrations depicting the people and places in the camps as accurately as possible, a glossary of terms, and a concluding article by Adam Cyra, PhD, who is a researcher and scholar at the Auschwitz Birkenau State Museum."

And now the lights are out in the village, the shepherds are asleep by the side of their flocks, the tinkling bell from the fold falls faintly on the still night air, and the watch-dog bays drowsily from his kennel at the gate. Good night, fair world; tis time to seek repose.

I could almost smell the Gothic barrio. I picked this novel up on a Sunday morning, intending only to read the opening salvo to decide whether I liked it enough to take with me on the train to work the next day. I didn't put it down until I'd finished it five and a half hours later. It is gripping, intelligent and deeply sensual but also witty and fast-moving. I found it utterly compelling. ... a city still experimenting after the death of Franco and dictatorship but bound by the memories of religious stricture. Nobody is quite what they seem and his moments of naive joy are cracked open by prejudice, poverty and an undercurrent of menace. It is packed with shady eccentric characters and sharp poetic imagery. There are also passages of almost scholarly historic reference and beautiful expositions of particularly poignant works of art that give the plot a rich cultural context. It's also funny and very very entertaining ... worth reading. And I hope this is an author worth watching out for. - Kate Margam, author of Milch Cow and Poor Kevin. Nothing is quite as it seems. This book rejoices in ambiguity and ambivalence, successfully capturing the zeitgeist of Barcelona in the period when the optimism and openness precipitated by the restoration of democracy in Spain was fading as the ETA terrorist campaign continued to take lives, political corruption was exposed by the uncensored media, and the city began to undergo massive redevelopment for the Olympic Games of 1992. Set mainly in the medieval Ciutat Vella (Old City), occasionally moving out to Camp Nou and the leafier uptown districts, the story unfolds through events narrated by two young men with very different backgrounds, perspectives and prospects. Both are engulfed by a nocturnal social milieu that will be immediately recognisable to anyone who experienced the last days of the notorious Barrio Chino before swathes of it were demolished. Eduardo, a diplomat's son used to a cosmopolitan life of privilege but traumatised by violent loss, is simultaneously dismissive of and drawn to tawdry ""lowlife"" decadence. Joaquim, escaping a stultifying rural Catalan background and intent on becoming an artist, is easily entranced by flamboyance, and soon exploited to paint and decorate the interior of an aristocratic but dilapidated old mansion inhabited by a colourful cast of exotic characters with shady sources of income. Of these, the most enigmatic is Celia, a beautiful outsider who remains out of focus until the climax. The narrators' depictions of alcohol-driven, drug-fuelled bohemian nights of poetry and song, revolving between bars, after-hours dives and shared flats in the Gothic Quarter, contrast with their personal moments of unease and self-doubt. Misunderstandings amongst the revellers induce mistrust, jealousy, anger and shame. The inaugural house party held in the mansion to celebrate the pagan Vispera de Sant Joan (Midsummer's Eve) brings these tensions to a sharp explosion of revelations and epiphanies. The author's knowledge and love of Barcelona are clear from his vivid descriptions of places, architecture and ambience. There are some lovely turns of phrase, with flashes of poetic imagery, startling similes and curious metaphors. The tone ranges from lightly self-deprecating to deeply philosophical, with some parts written in an almost scientifically disinterested style and others using language so alluring and sensual as to qualify as genuinely erotic, without being pornographic. As a meditation on sexuality, I found Celia's Room insightful and thought provoking. Perhaps more importantly, I enjoyed the story a lot, and at times laughed out loud. This intelligent and entertaining book is fun, and definitely well worth reading! - Francis Barret, literary blogger and long-time Barcelona resident."

In response to the requests of many users of the first edition, the number of exercises has been increased approximately thirty percent. Additional theory has been included, and improved demonstrations have replaced some of the earlier proofs. This edition contains one chapter more than the first edition. The major aims of this book remain unchanged-to provide a text in the spirit to the current emphasis on quality mathematics for all students of the subject and to make available to the student those ideas which are fundamental to the understanding of ordinary differential equations. The book is planned so that it may be used in different ways, depending on the preparation of the class. Experience in teaching the material indicates that students who have completed a sound course in elementary calculus will be able to understand the statements of all theorems and that they will find the solution of all but a few exercises attainable.

He exhibits freely in the streets of the world, catching the attention of people who are not typical museum visitors. His work mixes Art with Act, talks about commitment, freedom, identity and limit. After he found a camera in the Paris subway, he did a tour of European Street Art, tracking the people who communicate messages via the walls. Then, he started to work on the vertical limits, watching the people and the passage of life from the forbidden undergrounds and roofs of Paris. <br />In 2006, he achieved Portrait of a Generation, portraits of the suburban thugs that he posted, in huge formats, in the bourgeois districts of Paris. This illegal project became official when the Paris City Hall wrapped its building with JRs photos. In 2007, with Marco, he did Face 2 Face, the biggest illegal exhibition ever. JR posted huge portraits of Israelis and Palestinians face to face in eight Palestinian and Israeli cities, and on the both sides of the Security fence / Separation wall. The experts said it would be impossible. Still, he did it.<br />In 2008, he embarked on a long international trip for Women Are Heroes, a project in which he underlines the dignity of women who are often the targets of conflicts. At the same time, he created the project The Wrinkles of the City. JR aims to use the wrinkles of the inhabitants of a city to retell their history and memory of a country. He chose to visit cities where immense amounts of change have been experienced, such as Cartagena in Spain, Shanghai or Los Angeles.<br />In 2010, his film Women Are Heroes is presented at Cannes in competition for the Camera dOr. In 2011, he received the Ted Prize, which offers him the opportunity to make A wish to change the world. He created InsideOut, an international participatory art project that allows people worldwide to get their picture and paste it to support an idea, a project, an action and share their experience.<br />JR creates Pervasive Art that spreads uninvited on the buildings of the slums around Paris, on the walls in the Middle-East, on the broken bridges in Africa or the favelas in Brazil. Some elderly women become models for a day; some kids turn artists for a week. In this type of Art scene, there is no stage to separate the actors from the spectators. After these local exhibitions, the images were transported to London, New York, Berlin or Amsterdam where people could interpret them in the light of their own personal experience.<br />As he remains anonymous and doesnt explain his huge full frame portraits of people making faces, JR leaves the space empty for an encounter between the subject/protagonist and the passer-by/interpreter.<br />This is what JRs work is about. Raising questions."

She has written over 100 books that have been translated into 31 different languages, and over 10 million copies of her books have been sold worldwide. After graduating with an MBA from Harvard Business School, Lillian went on to pursue a highly successful business career in banking and finance in the 1980's in Hong Kong. Her business acumen, drive and abundant energy soon led her from the finance world to the world of luxury department stores and boutiques where, through a leveraged buy out, she became Chairman and shareholder of The Dragon Seed Group. All the while she was guided and taught by her feng shui masters in Hong Kong and China - and she attributes much of her monumental and quick rise to success in Hong Kong directly to them. Lillian soon decided to retire from active corporate life and return to Malaysia to raise her beautiful daughter, Jennifer, and spend more time with her family. It was at this time she began to devote her energy to writing and furthering her study of feng shui. She published her first book in Malaysia in1995 that quickly became a best seller and the rest is history. Today she is Chairman of Wofs.Com, a feng shui franchise and merchandising company run by her daughter, Jennifer Too. She trains feng shui students and future consultants at her Certified Consulting Institute in Malaysia and is much loved by her readers, associates and students for the way she teaches practical feng shui in a user-friendly way, using ordinary situations and circumstances that interest people and affect their everyday lives. In November 2009, at the International Feng Shui Convention in Singapore, the well-deserved title of GRAND MASTER OF FENG SHUI was conferred upon Lillian Too. Immediately following this accolade, in early January 2010, she received the prestigious Brand Laureate Personality of The Year Award presented by the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia! There seems to be no stopping her popularity and recognition these days! Lillian believes everyone should know her secrets and learn how to adapt feng shui to modern life.,,"

When you step into this session, it's as though you're stepping into a magical world full of wonder. You're actually entering a state of hypnosis that will help unleash your full potential.

Through repeated use of this session you will find that you become lucky more and more. This luck can manifest in every area of your life... from simply lucking into a great parking spot, to becoming luckier in a chance endeavor (such as gambling). Your mind will actually begin to influence your surroundings so that you actually create more luck opportunities for yourself, and in the meantime you may have flashes of intuition that lead you into a lucky situation or encounter. As you pay attention to your feelings before these lucky occurrences, you will become much more deliberate about following your lucky instincts.

The Instant Breakthrough series by Alex Armani features a dual suggestion format. This means you will enjoy two sets of suggestions running simultaneously. This allows you to benefit in several ways including increased effectiveness, quicker results, and enhanced pleasure.

The author has attempted to set down in simple language, not only the basic principles and practices, but also the more advanced techniques utilized by skilled, experienced scrapers. The arrangement of this book has a two-fold purpose. First, to acquaint the novice with the basic scraping procedures and to teach the principals involved. Second, to apply this knowledge to the specific problems of machine tool reconditioning. In describing the methods employed in treating the various machine tools, a progressive, step-by-step procedure is followed. Starting with an outline of the components, each part is sub-divided into its constituent bearing surfaces. The OBJECTIVES required of each surface are established, and accompanied by a more or less detailed explanation of the recommended treatment. In other words, each part of the entire operation is given and presented in the logical order. It should answer the questions, Where do I start? and, What next? Where sound alternative procedures are possible, they are mentioned. This has been done, not to make the work encyclopedic in content, but to suggest the use of other apparatus equally appropriate. Each major operation, and many minor ones, are graphically illustrated by perspective and mechanical drawings. These show the physical set-ups and utilize the very minimum of standard equipment. Many of the diagrams show the permissible tolerances in connection with alignments. The subject matter has been arranged, as far as possible, to make it useful as a handbook for foremen and other supervisory personnel...,,"

Elizabeth prefaced the book by saying: This book is probably best described not as an autobiographythats much too pretentiousbut as a long, slightly overcozy conversation with a garrulous broad named Betty Burton. I have no doubt that a lot of it will seem rather like a bad novelette. Im afraid much of my life has been a clicheexcept that at the time the feelings were tremendously deep. The small book is illustrated with fifty-six photographs from Elizabeths own collection; many lovingly taken by longtime friend and fellow actor Roddy McDowall, also a noted photographer who immortalized the likes of Judy Garland and Louise Brooks."

This process can be <br />compared with repeated diving into the ocean to collect precious gems that lie <br />on the ocean floor. Every time, the diver comes up with new discoveries and in <br />a similar manner, the diligent student of the Astanga Hridaya is able to <br />discover many layers of meanings and principles of Ayurveda through the <br />constant svadhyaya. Dr. Sanjay's verse by verse, word by word translation and <br />interpretation of the Astanga Hridaya is a good example of harvest that can be <br />reaped through Svadhyaya.

Verily from the beauty of Allahs legislation is that justice is established, and everything is given its rights, without excessiveness or neglect. For indeed Allah has ordered that there be justice, kindness, and assisting of the relatives. Due to justice the messengers were sent, the books were revealed, and the affairs of the worldly life and hereafter were established. Justice is giving everything its right and putting everything in its proper place, and this will not be accomplished except by knowing the rights so that they will be observed. Therefore, we have written this speech as an important explanation of these rights, so that the slave (of Allah) may do that which he knows from them according to the best of his ability, and this has been summarized in the following.

He had a love for people and was always broke. Decision time came and passed for NBC. NBC was committed to continue to air both Tales of the Texas Rangers and Presenting Charles Boyer--sustained--if necessary. When Fibber McGee and Molly and Johnson's Wax returned to reclaim their spot in NBC's Tuesday night line up, NBC moved Presenting Charles Boyer to a Thursday evening spot. For the Fall 1950 broadcasts of Presenting Charles Boyer, Herb Butterfield assumed the role of Bart Conway. The premise remained the same in all other respects, while NBC impatiently continued to seek a sponsor to bankroll the pricey 30-minute feature. As it transpired, NBC's patience ran out sometime around the 5th of October, at which point NBC announced that October 26th would be Presenting Charles Boyer's last episode. Cancellation of the Radio feature certainly had little effect on Charles Boyer's spectacular career. As it is, he probably breathed a quiet sigh of relief that he could move on to other projects. What remains of the series are twenty fascinating international mysteries with a decidedly humorous bent, starring Charles Boyer in his only dramatic lead in a Radio series. That would have been historically noteworthy in itself. But in fact, the series was wonderfully well written, crisply directed and brilliantly performed. All in all, a wonderful, often overlooked gem from The Golden Age of Radio. Text from Digital Deli Website"

It is charming and intimate. I felt I was actually there seeing New Zealand in the company of a friend. Denyse and her husband Sam are experienced travelers and their description of the people they meet, the colors, the terrain, come across sharp and clear. It is all about discovery. Focus is on the wonders around them and not on the problems of getting there. I eagerly looked forward to each new experience, the next town, the next batch of friendly backpackers, the next hostel.,If you are a devotee of travel books, you will love this one. If you're not, you will be by the time you have finished the tale.,It is an easy read, for a quiet afternoon, and the impressions linger long after you finally close the book. --Sonia Goldstein<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading <b>When the Kiwi Calls</b>. To me it wasn't so much a travel guide (there are enough of those in print and on the Internet) but a very entertaining account of an amazing journey in a wonderful country. We have visited New Zealand and I appreciated the descriptions and novel way of traveling and staying in backpacker hostels. If we go again, we'll definitely take Denyse's advice and stay at BBHs.,I also found the information about places and the culture and customs of the locals so interesting. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to visit the North Island, but from the descriptions in the book, it appears to be a magical place with amazing sights. I felt quite emotional reading about the kauri trees, the Huka Falls, the kayak ride to Cathedral cove, etc.,Well done! I will recommend this book to everyone as a great book, worth reading - even if one has never been or never plans to go to New Zealand. --Arlene Beham<br /><br />My husband and I <i>discovered</i> New Zealand in 2004 and have been back twice since. It's become our all-time favorite travel destination. Knowing this, a good friend gave me a copy of <b>When the Kiwi Calls</b>, and I was enthralled to find that we had visited almost all the same places as Denyse and her husband had and had many similar experiences and impressions.,Denyse is a wonderful writer, and her warmth comes through on every page. Her book is a charming mix of travel reference, photo journal and personal diary. If you've never visited New Zealand, your discovery of it through Denyse's eyes will most surely entice you to start planning a trip there. And if you already know first-hand why we love it so much, you'll definitely want to go back for more! --Carole Florian,,"

She has written over 100 books that have been translated into 31 different languages, and over 10 million copies of her books have been sold worldwide. After graduating with an MBA from Harvard Business School, Lillian went on to pursue a highly successful business career in banking and finance in the 1980's in Hong Kong. Her business acumen, drive and abundant energy soon led her from the finance world to the world of luxury department stores and boutiques where, through a leveraged buy out, she became Chairman and shareholder of The Dragon Seed Group. All the while she was guided and taught by her feng shui masters in Hong Kong and China - and she attributes much of her monumental and quick rise to success in Hong Kong directly to them. Lillian soon decided to retire from active corporate life and return to Malaysia to raise her beautiful daughter, Jennifer, and spend more time with her family. It was at this time she began to devote her energy to writing and furthering her study of feng shui. She published her first book in Malaysia in1995 that quickly became a best seller and the rest is history. Today she is Chairman of Wofs.Com, a feng shui franchise and merchandising company run by her daughter, Jennifer Too. She trains feng shui students and future consultants at her Certified Consulting Institute in Malaysia and is much loved by her readers, associates and students for the way she teaches practical feng shui in a user-friendly way, using ordinary situations and circumstances that interest people and affect their everyday lives. In November 2009, at the International Feng Shui Convention in Singapore, the well-deserved title of GRAND MASTER OF FENG SHUI was conferred upon Lillian Too. Immediately following this accolade, in early January 2010, she received the prestigious Brand Laureate Personality of The Year Award presented by the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia! There seems to be no stopping her popularity and recognition these days! Lillian believes everyone should know her secrets and learn how to adapt feng shui to modern life."

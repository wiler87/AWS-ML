Detailed descriptions of the major historic sites will help understand their development, as well as locating sites and understanding what can be seen there.

Goedicke's rapid and often lengthy lines, her frequent all-over-the-page stanzaic layouts and her abrupt tonal jumps suffuse her poems with a desperate, eclectic energy, one that counterpoints the poems' quotidian occasions--a shared meal, a shared bed, TV ""snow,"" a house cat. If her visual descriptions falter, she makes up for it with a superb understanding of pace and of breath: her arrangements of phrases, even single words, into tenuous verse-paragraphs often describe an attempt to draw lasting strength from some glimpsed symbol or happy moment. Goedicke's penchant for evocative abstractions can make her poems, and their titles, blur together: is ""What Holds Us Together"" only ""What the Dust Does,"" or does it include ""The Things I May Not Say""? And her associative enthusiasms can generate clich?s and mixed metaphors: during a marital quarrel ""black golfballs run down the face as the house jackhammers ... into two poles staring across chasms."" But such imprecisions may be a worthwhile price to pay for the best of Goedicke's new work--for its desperation of last chances (""the random cha-cha of cells hacked/ into smaller metaphysical tatters""); for its strikingly juxtaposed, compact images, from gulls and oceans to skyscrapers and ""little cakes""; for its exploration of life's approaching endings, and of the energies we need to face them. <br />Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.
						    	
						        	--This text refers to an alternate <a href=""/dp/1556591349/ref=dp_bookdescription?_encoding=UTF8&amp;n=283155"">Paperback</a> edition.,In her twelfth book of poems, Goedicke uses complex forms with surety and verve, drawing in readers with her elegance, then ambushing them with the storminess of her emotions. Her theme here is old and enduring love, the gnawed-at bond between longtime mates that survives epic quarrels and the creeping assault of age, and embodies a transcendent eroticism. Goedicke opens up descriptions of personal intimacies to encompass a cellular unity with all of life. ""I've never been able to tell / where we end and earth begins beyond us,"" she writes in the title poem. But she is very much present in the cultural world, too, and writes as naturally about movie myths as about the moon, and limns landscapes spiked with satellite dishes, torn by crashing airplanes, and scoured by cars. The earth is as tender and marked as our skin, and Goedicke reads both with sharp eyes, then tells their stories in poems that strike the body first, then ignite the mind.  <i>Donna Seaman</i>

References to yoga practices--spiritual disciplines and techniques of meditation which enable a man to achieve unitive knowledge of the Godhead-are to be found, already, in the Katha, Swetaswtara, Taittiriya, and Maitrayani Upanishads, very many centuries earlier. Indeed, the yoga doctrine may be said to have been handed down from prehistoric times. What Patanjali did was to restate yoga philosophy and practice for the man of his own period. But what was his period? And who was Patanjali? Hardly anything is known about him. Some authorities believe that there were actually two Patanjalis, one a grammarian and the other the author of the Sutras. Others deny this. As for the date of the Sutras, the guesses of scholars vary widely, ranging from the fourth century B.C. to the fourth century A.D."

They are such pitiful things! Did you ever give some thought to how frustrated YOU can be when you yourself are sick? When you are sick you can't even think straight! There are many cliches which contain more truth than fiction, such as: You are what you eat. You are what you think. You are as old  or as young as you think... The root of all these epigrammatic maxims lies in every phase of your existence; in your emotional state, in the food you eat and in the extent that waste matter is eliminated from your body. When I expound on clarity of intellect, on the power of the mind, on the state of consciousness that places one on a higher plane of understanding that broadens one's perspective, expands one's perceptions, and sharpens one's intelligence, I expound on these because experience and observations have proved... that through VIBRANT HEALTH all these are possible."

Although Guccione was American, the magazine was founded in 1965, in the United Kingdom, but beginning in September 1969, was sold in the United States as well. At the height of his success, Guccione, who died in 2010, was considered to be one of the richest men in the United States. He was once listed in the Forbes 400 ranking of wealthiest people (1982]). An April 2002 New York Times article reported Guccione as saying that Penthouse grossed $3.5 billion to $4 billion over the 30-year life of the company, with net income of almost half a billion dollars. The Penthouse logo is a stylized key which incorporates both the Mars and Venus symbols in its design. The magazine's centerfold models are known as Penthouse Pets and customarily wear a distinctive necklace inspired by said logo."

Staying neutral was an artform that the Dutch managed to master through clever diplomacy, conscientious adherence to international laws, comprehensive mobilisation of its armed forces, regular patrols of its territorial boundaries, careful policing of its citizens, and a decisive measure of good fortune.

It can be an exhilarating part of being human. Yet there is wide disagreement about meanings, means, and ends. The approach of this book is that modern social trends toward self-gratifiction and self-indulgence have produced a form of ""intimacy"" which is without foundation in reality and is supported only by a facade of illusion. The author, Dr. Victor L. Brown, Jr., brings much professional research and comment to the support of his arguments, along with many illustrative stories from his experience in counseling. Written for the layman in understandable language, this best-selling book sets forth clearly that it is in a sustained, persistent effort in marriage that true intimacy of heart, mind, and body can be achieved.""

Travis McGee's 20th--which finds him enjoying life on his Florida houseboat, trying to keep his affair with hotel-manager Anne Renzetti on an even keel. But then best friend Meyer's niece Norma dies violently--when she and her charming new husband Evan go for a honeymoon trip on Meyer's cruiser. . . which blows to smithereens. The question for McGee and Meyer: was Evan on board when the explosion hit? There's enough evidence to the contrary to send them on the trail into Evan's past--which involves pseudonyms, stripped bank accounts, unsolved disappearances, and a string of """"accidental"""" deaths. Eventually, then, the sleuths wind up in upstate N.Y. with Evan's sister Helen June, a slatternly trailer-dweller surrounded by rust and junk. And her confessions lead McGee to Mexico, gorgeous Barbara Castillo (an indirect victim of the murderer), and a plan to trap the culprit. Surprises? Very few. But if MacDonald's formula varies little, the shrewd vignettes of places and people continue to be vividly engaging--and his masterly pacing ensures absorbing, taut reading every time around."

Here is the drama behind the creation of Manhattan, a first-of-its-kind prime-time television series produced by Melvin Wechsler. Tempered by tragedy, seasoned by success, a man with a Midas touch, Mel Wechsler will assemble a dazzling cast: Sabina Quarles at forty-five has managed to maintain&ndash;by dint of spunk and surgery&ndash;the body of an eighteen-year-old. Tough, spirited, and self-sufficient, she has survived twenty years in Hollywood, never marrying, never quite succeeding, never deigning to work in television. Yet Manhattan may bring her both the stardom she cravesand the security her very special needs require. Jane Adams is an earthy thirty-nine-year-old beauty. Devoted to her children, dominated by her abusive and violent husband, forced to choose between her husband and her acting career, Jane may find that her role in Manhattan has cost her everything that matters most. Zack Taylor, the leading man, is a paragon of professionalism. Yet beyond the smooth good looks, the easy warmth, and the slick charm of the eligible bachelor, he remains an enigma. The charming ingenue, Gabrielle Thornton-Smith, seems to have appeared out of the blue. Beautiful, talented and on the brink of success at twenty-five, what can she have to hide? And Bill Warwick, plucked from the ranks of struggling young actors, is now slated to be the nations new heartthrob. But he has lied about one issue in his background. Not only will Bills future hang in the balance, but the success of the whole series may be jeopardized when he is forced publicly to confront the consequences of his little white lie."

Thousands of people like Bill are entering our churches. Theyre coming to the Church for answers. But the extent of their problems and reluctance of Christians to become involved with these hurting people leaves them at a loss, unable to turn their lives around. Who will help them if the Church will not? This book will help you be prepared to help new Christians escape the temptations of their old lifestyles; learn how to respond to the problems of divorce, drug addiction, homosexuality, and child abuse; and equip yourself to keep new believers from slipping through the cracks back into the old world."

How do great managers inspire top performance in employees? How do they generate enthusiasm, unite disparate personalities to focus on a common mission, and drive teams to achieve ever-higher goals?

More than a decade ago, The Gallup Organization combed through its database of more than 1 million employee and manager interviews to identify the elements most important in sustaining workplace excellence. These elements were revealed in the 1999 bestseller First, Break All the Rules. 12: The Elements of Great Managing is that management classic's long-awaited sequel. It follows great managers as they implement the 12 elements to turn around a failing call center, save a struggling hotel, improve patient care in a hospital, maintain production through power outages, and successfully face a host of other challenges in settings around the world.

Gallup's study now includes 10 million employee and manager interviews spanning 114 countries and conducted in 41 languages. In 12, authors Rodd Wagner and James K. Harter weave the latest Gallup insights with recent discoveries in the fields of neuroscience, game theory, psychology, sociology, and economics. Written for managers and employees of companies large and small, 12 explains what every company needs to know about creating and sustaining employee engagement."

These
people trace their history from the journey of Hagoth into the Land Northward up to the present day. They were
written upon plates of various metals and alloys of metals, processed animal hides and paper velum. The
records were archived in several locations in North and Central America anciently, but the only surviving
copies of the histories of the Nemenhah, of which we have anything to do, have been strictly guarded in the
libraries of Sanpete County, Utah. When the Mormons came into the Sanpete valley they were met by American Natives who had been forewarned in dreams and visions of their coming and of their complete conquest of the region. After converting
to the new religion, several of the Chiefs of these Americans met with Brigham Young to give into his keeping
a copy of the libraries hidden in the hills of the Wasatch Front, as part of their consecration to the United Order.
They were pleased that the men of prophecy had come because this meant that they could leave the valley and
return to where their families had originally come. Pres. Young informed them, however, that they would have
to remain but for a little while longer. His words to them; for we have not wherewith to translate these
records, are still repeated today by certain of their descendents....In 1957, the Council requested that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints translate and publish the books of the library. They report that the Brethren of the Church with whom they met responded just as Pres. Young had to the Chiefs of the Indians in Sanpete County  We have no way of translating these things. No one speaks this language anymore. From that day the Council undertook the task of making a translation of the works from Nemenhah into Quiche, the languages being similar, and a sort of Rosetta Stone being provided by one of the ancient authors of the records."

Rivlin focuses our attention on how the Arab world has squandered the 'demographic gift' of a rapidly growing work force and shrinking portion of dependents. He shows how political conservatism has not only been supported by oil revenues and remittances, it has blocked the reforms needed to promote modern education and rapid industrialization. As a result, rapid labor force growth has not been a source of rising productivity, but of rising unemployment, political restiveness, and radicalism."" - Jack A. Goldstone, George Mason University<br /><br />""Rivlin's book is a must-read for anyone seeking to understand the causes and consequences of the poor economic performance of the Arab economies. It presents a coherent and comprehensive analysis of the economic, social, and political factors that hinder economic development and prevent political changes in this important part of the world."" - Avner Greif, Stanford University<br /><br />""Once home to major commercial centers, the Arab world is now a minor player in the world economy. In this nicely crafted book, Paul Rivlin lays out the relevant facts and figures with close attention to variations across countries. He also offers a bold interpretation that centers on institutions, demographic trends, and constraints rooted in religion. The research is imaginative and the synthesis both original and provocative."" - Timur Kuran, Duke University<br /><br />""Rivlin skillfully addresses in comparative context the vital issue of how Arab political economies are dealing with their 'youth bulge.' His investigation of their failure adequately to capitalize on this potential human resource asset sheds valuable new light on both this specific topic and the more general one of Arab economic development."" - Robert Springborg, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey<br /><br />""Rivlin's strength is in placing contemporary developments in a long historical perspective. He is particularly interested in labor market trends, such as job creation and unemployment for the youth bulge produced by high past population growth.... Recommended."" - Choice,This book examines the relationship between demographic and economic development in Arab countries and asks why this imbalance has continued so long. It examines historic explanations for its economic failures, some of which are quite controversial."

She has written over 100 books that have been translated into 31 different languages, and over 10 million copies of her books have been sold worldwide. After graduating with an MBA from Harvard Business School, Lillian went on to pursue a highly successful business career in banking and finance in the 1980's in Hong Kong. Her business acumen, drive and abundant energy soon led her from the finance world to the world of luxury department stores and boutiques where, through a leveraged buy out, she became Chairman and shareholder of The Dragon Seed Group. All the while she was guided and taught by her feng shui masters in Hong Kong and China - and she attributes much of her monumental and quick rise to success in Hong Kong directly to them. Lillian soon decided to retire from active corporate life and return to Malaysia to raise her beautiful daughter, Jennifer, and spend more time with her family. It was at this time she began to devote her energy to writing and furthering her study of feng shui. She published her first book in Malaysia in1995 that quickly became a best seller and the rest is history. Today she is Chairman of Wofs.Com, a feng shui franchise and merchandising company run by her daughter, Jennifer Too. She trains feng shui students and future consultants at her Certified Consulting Institute in Malaysia and is much loved by her readers, associates and students for the way she teaches practical feng shui in a user-friendly way, using ordinary situations and circumstances that interest people and affect their everyday lives. In November 2009, at the International Feng Shui Convention in Singapore, the well-deserved title of GRAND MASTER OF FENG SHUI was conferred upon Lillian Too. Immediately following this accolade, in early January 2010, she received the prestigious Brand Laureate Personality of The Year Award presented by the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia! There seems to be no stopping her popularity and recognition these days! Lillian believes everyone should know her secrets and learn how to adapt feng shui to modern life.,,"

Noblewoman Alanna of Trebond, disguised as the boy ""Alan,"" exchanges places with her twin brother Thom, to go to the royal palace in the city of Corus to train for knighthood, while Thom studies magic. Throughout the four novels Alanna befriends George, the king of the thieves; the scholar Sir Myles of Olau; senior students Gareth (Gary) of Naxen, Raoul of Goldenlake, and Prince Jonathan of Cont; Princess Thayet of Sarain; Liam Ironarm, a martial-arts champion; and Buriram (Buri) Tourakom, Thayet's bodyguard. Her principal rivals are classmate Ralon of Malven, and Jonathan's kinsman Duke Roger, who becomes the chief antagonist in the final book. In the second volume, Alanna also acquires the magical cat 'Faithful', who accompanies her thereafter (Faithful is hinted to be an immortal, but his origins remain unknown. In the Beka Cooper trilogy, it is guessed that Faithfulthere known as 'Pounce'is a constellation named ""The Cat"" who periodically comes down to Earth), and support by a deity, the Great Mother Goddess. By reason of her double identity, small size, inherent magic, and impatience, Alanna is often shown questioning her own character; but resolves these questions in the third book, in which she becomes an honorary member of the 'Bazhir' (a Bedouin-like ethnicity), through gaining unique acceptance because of her gender. In the final volume, she becomes King's Champion to Jonathan and Baroness of the coastal estate Pirate's Swoop."

It takes place sometimes betwee tw o who are unsuited, but still it is profound.&quot; Surely no two could have seemed less suited than he and Ruth--he a sensitive artist, son of a rich and proud family, widely traveled, cosmopolitan, and she the unlettered daughter of a farmer. She could never come into his world, and he came into hers--giving up, for their deep love, his family and fame and almost all else that he had known. Yet at the end of nearly fifty years he could think, with gratitude to her, how rich his life had been, how little he had lost to gain happiness. This story of the marriage of a couple so unlike, tells also of the curious exchange of traits--her beauty in this child, his ranging mind in that one, her strength here, his delicate touch there--and in a grandchild the sudden thrust of his genius. Always in Pearl Buck&apos;s novels the people quickly become far more important than the setting or the period, and perhaps this is why critics so often apply to her themes the large term &apos;universal.&apos; But it is interesting that the scene of Portrait of a Marriage is the Pennsylvania countryside in which she has lived for the past ten years."

His latest modus operandi is to have his men use the chemical on persons suspected of unsolved crimes, force the victims to return the loot at a specific place and time, and snatch the swag while they are delivering it. Their first target is Jarvis Skibo, who fearfully returns $50,000 in stolen bonds to a bank. But Batman discovers Skibo's identity through an informant, and has Commissioner Gordon leak the information that the bonds returned were counterfeit. The Scarecrow attempts to terrorize Skibo again, but Batman appears to fight him and the Strawmen. The villains manage an escape. Batman pries the details of the Scarecrow's operation from Skibo. He then disguises himself as Thurston Blaine, who is suspected of stealing a Gutenberg Bible. When the Scarecrow and his gang attempt to terrorize him, Batman reveals himself, resists the fear chemical, and battles and captures them."

Its main characteristic is its striking precision and at the same time, the artistic creativity with which the information is conveyed to the reader. On not a single page is the reader left wondering about unexplained terms. This is how a religious tradition should be transmitted to an audience that, for various reasons have no longer grown up in a traditional atmosphere. <br /><br /> ----Prof. Monika Boehm-Tettelbach. Head, Department of Modern Indian Studies, South Asia Institute, University of Heidelberg, Germany<br /><br /><br />The first part: <i>The Life and Times of the Vachanamrut</i> makes a very interesting reading full of vivid details on the late 18th and early 19th century Gujarat and specially Saurashtra. Again the concern for precise and practical details, somewhat anthropological, renders part 2: <i>Introducing the Vachanamrut</i> and part 3: <i>The opening paragraphs of the Vachanamrut</i> a good source for a student of both religious history of Gujarat and the Swaminarayan Sampraday. Parts 4 to 8 concern more a spiritual approach of the sacred scripture; yet the meticulous care in explaining clearly the concepts and terminology may be useful to the scholar as well. I think that the whole book is not only a mine of information but a very sympathetic approach to this exceptional text, as, in fact, it is the only pre-modern piece of prose in Gujarati and almost in the whole of religious literature in neo-Indo-Aryan languages. <br /> ----Prof. Francois Mallison, Director of Studies, Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, Historical and Philological Sciences at the Sorbonne, Paris, France<br /><br />Once in a while there comes a great book which makes the reader wish that he had something to do with its production. This is one such... <i>The Handbook </i> is a work of art in itself... This Handbook is one of the finest examples of expository writing this reviewer has seen. With such an intelligent and comprehensive aid by the side of a religious text, there is no reason why the youngest person should not read or understand a text of importance. The production values are exquisite. Beautiful illustrations, clear and aesthetic, adorn the book. The maps are works of art. Clarity is present everywhere in the typeface, in the illustrations and one noteworthy feature is the comments on the margin of every page. --<i>The Vedant Kesari</i>, Shri Ramkrishna Mission, Chennai, India,Sadhu Mukundcharandas grew up in the United Kingdom, where he studied pharmacy before ultimately deciding to dedicate his life to spiritual pursuits. A Hindu monk for the last thirty years, he has seen Hinduism through the eyes of a Westerner, embraced it wholeheartedly as a practitioner, and studied it rigorously as a scholar. Indeed, he was a star student at the Swaminarayan School of Philosophy in Gujarat, India. One of his greatest passions is sharing his learning: he has authored eight books on Hinduism."

An exclusive journey chasing doves, pigeons, ducks, pheasants and quails, captured and narrated by world renowned hunting writer and photographer Stuart Williams. 
A must have book, for anyone who is thinking about Wingshooting in Mexico.
Airboats roared back and forth and up and down, putting great swarms of ducks to flight. A wave of 100 redheads sailed by, then turned and banked against the wind, and settled on the water about 100 yards away. Gradually they swam into the decoys, whereupon the birdboy shouted and put them to flight, and I put down four birds with two shots. Then another wave sailed in well within range, and I put down four -mirabile dictu- with the first shot and one with the second.
Through the images and words of Stuart Williams, Wingshooting Mexico is a unique opportunity for hunters who have not yet traveled to Mexico to become familiar with this extraordinary place. It is also a chance, for those who have already been there, to look back upon one of the most fantastic hunting experiences in the world. Wingshooting Mexico is a 156 page visual survey of the best hunting locations and lodges in this magnificent land South of the Border.
The book will take you on a guided tour of the States of Sinaloa, Tamaulipas, Baja California and Zacatecas. Experience hunts with Mexicos finest Outfitters: Sinalopato, Solimar, Hidalgo Lodge, Anglers Inn, Pichiguila, Dunkin of Tamaulipas, Rancho Ala
Blanca, Baja Hunting and Sierra Madre. Stuart Willliams has made over 40 trips to Mexico and now you can be a part of the experience.,,"

Her experiences -- from snowbound months in a two-room cabin to sub-zero treks for food to the sheer joy of spring -- are a must-read for anyone who loves the untamed nature and wondrous beauty of Maine's north woods and the unique spirit of those who lived there. In the 1930s, in spite of being warned that remote Churchill Depot was ""no place for a woman,"" the remarkable Helen Hamlin set off at age 20 to teach school at the tiny and isolated lumber camp at the headwaters of the Allagash River. After teaching for one year, she married a game warden and moved even deeper into the wilderness, where she spent her next three years. In her book, Hamlin captures that time in her life, complete with the trappers, foresters, lumbermen, woods folk, wild animals and natural splendor that she found at Umsaskis Lake and then at Nine Mile Bridge on the St. John River.,,"

He argues, ably, logically and Scripturally that Christ died for all men. The Bible does not, he maintains, teach a Limited Atonement. Formerly, he was inclined to view this doctrine as rather innocuous. However, his thorough investigation has led him to look upon it as injurious. But he is no universalist or modernist. He is biblical, evangelical and moderately Calvinistic. Mr. Douty does believe in predestination and election. God has eternally elected to salvation those who are saved, but has passed by the rest of men. The non-elect are lost, however, not through God's fault, but through their own unwillingness to recent and believe. Christ died for the lost as well as for the saved. This position encourages evangelism and missions. Readers will enjoy the irenic spirit, the copious arguments, the exegesis of many Bible passages, and the numerous citations for renowned theologians."

They were among the best-known storytellers of folk tales, and popularized stories such as &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;The Frog Prince&quot;, &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, &quot;Rapunzel&quot;, &quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot;, and &quot;Snow White&quot;. Their first collection of folk tales, Children&apos;s and Household Tales, was published in 1812. The popularity of the Grimms&apos; collected folk tales has endured well. The tales are available in more than 100 languages and have been later adapted by filmmakers. In the mid-20th century, the tales were used as propaganda by the Third Reich; later in the 20th century psychologists such as Bruno Bettelheim reaffirmed the value of the work, in spite of the cruelty and violence in original versions of some of the tales, which the Grimms eventually sanitized. The Grimms&apos; stories have continued to be resilient and popular around the world. Nevertheless, children remain enamored with grim stories as the recent success of The Grimm Series by Adam Gidwitz and The Sisters Grimm by Michael Buckley illustrates."

Here's a book that's long been needed.  And it's a book that animal owners will turn to again and again.  It's not a book for veterinarians but for people who love and own animals and want to better understand their animals' needs and health problems.  Dr. Spaulding describes his book as a bridge between animal owners and veterinarians - a guide that will help livestock and pet owners to be better equipped to prevent many problems, spot others early enough to control and rectify difficulties, and know what to do in a crisis situation.  A Veterinary Guide for Animals Owners is organized by animal:  cattle, goats, sheep, horses, pigs, poultry, rabbits, dogs and cats.  In each chapter you'll find information on general care and management, and on specific health problems to which that particular animal is susceptible.  Under general management there is information on proper housing and feeding, restraint, breeding and deliveries, neutering and proper grooming.  In the sections on health problems, you'll find out about the symptoms, causes and cures of diseases, injuries, and other health conditions and when and what you should do about them - when you can treat them yourself and when you should call your vet.  One very important part of the book explains such basics as rug administration; antibiotics, viruses, and bacteria; handling animals in shock; body temperature; and first aid.  Illustrated throughout."

The ""strength training"" jokes and the feminist fun may mean more to adults than kids, but the bright ink-and-watercolor illustrations in cartoon style manage to make the fowl seem almost human. The birds' body language tells a story that will make kids laugh at the self-important, bossy rooster, who refuses to know his place. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br /><i>Copyright  American Library Association.

The ups and downs of disappointed love: who could fail to sympathize with the feelings that Schumann immortalized in his song cycle Dichterliebe after Heine? The pieces range from hopeful anticipation (Im wunderschnen Monat Mai) to solitary grief (Und wssten's die Blumen, die kleinen) and bitter sarcasm (Die alten bsen Lieder). Schumann knew what he was writing about: the cycle originated in the year of his marriage to Clara Wieck, an event that took place only after years of struggle. Originally the sixteen-piece cycle was meant to include twenty lieder. Our volume reproduces the four discarded numbers in an appendix."
